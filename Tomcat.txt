56012	Consistency in space at top of launch configuration tabs	Some of the tabs have space at the top, some do not.I would propose we be consistent and have no space at the top of the tabs. This helps with the requirements of the tabs fitting on the screen when using high contrast. I think we should really re-vamp the layout on many tabs. Not sure we'll have the cycles though. Fixed.

55943	[Global Sync] Global sync and workspace population	It would be nice if we could tie global sync to workspace population, at least for CVS. When I started up an empty workspace, the global sync button was in the toolbar. Selecting CVS gave me a page which stated there were no CVS projects in my workspace. It would be nice if the user was given the opportunity to create repository locations and checkout projects at this point.I don't know if we want to have the checkout part of the global sync wizard in general but it would be really helpful if it was part of the no-project case. *** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 62962 *** 	2014-01-01 10:02:46	1388590000.0	resolved fixed	f28800c	1389970000.0	java/org/apache/catalina/loader/WebappClassLoader.java
56025	Log goes in config area then gets blown away by PDE	"build I20040324-0800Scenario: I want to run my RCP app as a runtime-workbench, where my workspaceand/or install contain other plugins that I don't want picked up for free.Example: the RCP browser example- load org.eclipse.ui.examples.rcp.browser- create a runtime workbench launch config for it- on the plugins page, carefully choose the plugins required:  - org.eclipse.core.runtime  - org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility  - org.eclipse.osgi.*  - org.eclipse.swt and its platform fragment  - org.eclipse.jface  - org.eclipse.ui  - org.eclipse.ui.workbench  - org.eclipse.ui.examples.rcp.browser- accidentally omit one of the above (in my case, it was the browser plugin (OK, so I'm sleep-deprived))- run - the process comes up then terminates with no help- no workspace directory exists yet- PDE has blown away the config area, so there's no log to consultThis makes it really hard to debug this stuff, which is tricky enough to beginwith.  And I have a clue where to look.  Novice RCP developers will not.Is there anything that can be done, either in the runtime or PDE, to simplifythis for M8? I notice the Plugins tab now has Add Required Plugins, which helps (as long asyou don't forget the app plugin like me).  But it's still easy for people tomake a mistake here, so it should be easy to find out what's wrong. Dup.  Runtime is not throwning an exception all the way back so PDE does not know that there was a failure.  However, PDE likely blow away the config area anyway.  We may be able to do something for M8 but this feels tricky to coordinate so would like the feeling that it is really important before trying.*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 56002 *** reopening and moving to PDE.  Runtime will use bug 56002 as its tracker. Please see the suggestion in bug 56002 comment #7. Currently, upon exit code 13, if PDE detects a log file in the workspace area, we tell the user and offer to open it.  The reason why we were not doing it for the other log is because we were not aware of it (until last Thurs that is).  We should definitely account for it.Recently though, I noticed that the log written to the config area is not called .log anymore, it is named for it seems to be a timestamp.  I'm not sure why the change (Jeff could comment here), but it makes sense more difficult. One more thing:As for deleting the config area, we should definitely change the semantic of this action to delete upon launching, and not upon termination. (to be consistent with deleting the workspace area).The default would be to delete the config area.  This is because most users are unaware and do not care about config area.  If we did not delete by default, the pde core metadata (where we keep them) could accumulate a lot of garbage over time. We should be able to make good progress on this.  The config log is timestamped because you could have several instances of the same config running at the same time.  You need a way of distinguishing the logs.  Note however that since you are in control of the config area a) there should really only be one *.log file there (assuming you clean it out before running) and b) you don't really care what the timestamp is, you just look for something .log.Note that there is currently (I believe) a bug whereby under certain circumstances the config log is called simply .log rather than <timestamp>.log.  This is being fixed but may not be committed yet.  Changing the default to delete the config area on startup would go a long way here.In the longer term there is a new story for returning values to whoever invoked Eclipse.  We (will) use this to return the actual location of the log file we are using and other information depending on the case.  PDE may want to use this both to better match the normal running case and to give users more information. The simplest and most accurate solution would be for me to scan:1. the workspace metadata for the .log file2. the config area for all *.log filesTake a look at all the files found in 1 and 2 and display the one with the latest timestamp to the user. Deleting the config area on launch rather than termination would help a lot.The PDE config area is pretty buried, though it is referred to in the commandline args.  Having some kind of detection of the log files like you proposewould be good.  Not sure about picking one log over the others though.  We'vehad cases where the same invocation can write to both the config log and theworkspace log. >Not sure about picking one log over the others though.  We've>had cases where the same invocation can write to both the config log and the>workspace log.Picking the latest one among all *.log files would definitely contain the last thing that went wrong before the application exited.Two problems with your suggestion:1. If we always pick the latest from the config area AND the the one in the workspace metadata, there is a pretty good chance that one of these files will be stale and not be relevant to why this particular launch exited abnormally.2. This one is purely esthetic.  I'm not sure how we would present the option to the user to open the two files.. Two buttons: one for each file?  Are the buttons in a message dialog?  If they are in a message dialog, when do we dismiss it?  Do we concatenate the two files?  Probably not a good idea. Well, anything would be an improvement over the situation now, and keeping itsimple is good at this point. Absolutely.  Plus, at 12:30 am you would agree to anything :-) Done.Changed the semantics of clearing to ""before launching"" not after.We look for all the log files and offer to open the latest. Wassim, do you take the exit code to understand if an error happened, or youjust look for log files ? exit code 13 only. For clarity here, our fix to bug 56002 and bug 55768 result in a log that is either    <config>/<timestamp>.logor    <instance>/.metadata/.logUnless something very strange happens (or we have a bug) only one of these log files should be present when the system exits.

55804	"allow ordering in ""Run As >"" context menu"	"I find it confusing to the user that the launch shortcuts shown on the ""Run >"" context menu do not match those that appear in the ""Run As"" on the toolbar button. One is selection based, where the other is perspective based, which means you get different lists in each perspective.I'd like to see the two lists always match, and preferrably using what is currently in the ""Run >"" context menu. Since the menu is dynamic, it is ""correct"" much more often and is based on the selection. The two options can share the selection context, so it should not require additional computation to (e.g.) show the Run As after using the context menu. Would this mean scrapping the perspective-based idea? This would be good for me, because my perspective uses the run and debug toolbar launch icons, and is not defined in the list of perspectives in the the platform's shortcuts(e.g. Java application, applet, etc). The only way I see I can get the launch shortcuts is to completely redefine and implement them myself just for my perspective, which is bad. Or, am I just missing something? We do not intend to change this in 3.0. Since contextual launch shortcuts (i.e. context menu in navigator) are optional, the ""Run As >"" menu in the drop-down provide a way for all shortcuts to be present in the window.Deferred for post 3.0 consideration. The Run on Server, Debug on Server, Profile on Server shortcuts will not appearin the ""Run As >"" (or Run toolbar) unless they are specifically included in thecurrent perspective's plugin.xml (regardless of context, such as a JSP fileselected in the Navigator).So in some perspectives, the ""xxx on Server"" shortcuts will not be included inthe ""Run As > "" menu, but will only be available via the ""Run>"" context menu.  So the ""Run As >"" menu in this scenario, does not actually present all relevantshortcuts.  This is a fairly significant usability issue as many users (especially users ofthe WSSD product) do not use context menus but rather use the main menu (andtherefore the Run menu) to run.  The user might use the ""Run As >"" menu and thenbe unable to ""Run on Server"".  A possible solution would be to truely make the ""Run As >"" menu display allshortcuts and have it display all shortcuts the Perspective is aware of as wellas all context-sensitive shortcuts (for the currently selected object).  Is this something that could be done for 3.0? But.... the whole reason we have the context menu is to present only the run actions that make sense for the selection (to avoid having all possible lanuch config types appear).  I did not mean to suggest the ""Run >"" context menu include all shortcuts. Rather, I meant to suggest that the ""Run as >"" under the main ""Run"" menu (at thetop of the window) should include all launch shortcuts, including the ones thatare in context for the selection.So the ""Run->Run As >"" from the main menu would display all shortcuts relevantfor the perspective plus all shortcuts relevant to the selection.  For example,if a JSP was selected in the Web Perspective, the ""Run->Run As >"" would displayall shortcuts relevant to the Web Perspective (as defined in its plugin.xml) andall shortcuts relevant to the JSP file (that would include the Run on Server,etc. launch shortcuts in the ""Run->Run As >"" menu).  If the user was to use thecontext menu on the selected JSP file (""Run >"" menu) the user would only see thelaunch shortcuts that make sense for the selection. I see - are there many use cases where there are contextual launch shortcuts that do not already exist for the perspective? Hi Darin,Yes, I've seen this several times. A typical case would be in a new perspective that did not exist in the product that the launch shortcut was defined in. For instance, Java launch shortcuts would not appear in any new perspectives in WebSphere Studio, even if the perspective shows Java artifacts or resources. I'm not certain of all of the cases where contextual launch shortcuts do not already exist for the perspective.  However, some examples where itshould be possible to perform a launch using the ""Run->Run As >""include:1) Server tools (to run on server from various perspectives)2) launching XSL Transformations (it should be able to run an XSL Transformationfrom any perspective where the user can access the XSL resource, such as theResource Perspective, Java Perspective, or others)3) launching tests (e.g., Hyades or tests based on Hyades). It should bepossible to launch a test both in the Hyades Test Perspective and potentiallyother Perspectives that may not be aware of Hyades. Are there plans to re-open this bug for 3.0? We do not intend to address this for 3.0. We've had several usability concerns come up over this, from shortcuts not appearing in the right perspectives, items from the Run > menu not appearing here, etc. Given how pervasive this is becoming and the number of people concerned about this issue, I'm raising the priority/severity and reopening.Sorry Darin :) (adjusted priority. priority field is set by committers.) Adding e-mail conversations to bug report history, so community may benefit:(Darin Wright)(1) Since ""contextual"" launch shortcuts are new in 3.0, we must be backwards compatible, and allow launch shorcuts to appear in the ""Run As"" (top level) menu even when they do not provide context launch information. (That is, we cannot only support contextual launch, since implementors are not required to provide the contextual information).(2) Computing the contextual information takes time (we've had a few complaints about this). Thus displaying in ""Run As"" (top level) menu is fast (since the information is statically computed), whereas displaying the ""Run >"" context menu can be sluggish. I believe the only real problem may be that an appropriate shortcut may be missing from the top level (static) menu, in perspectives that the shortcut definition does not know about. (i.e. new perspectives added on top of the shortcut definition). Thus, it has been suggested that we could add an ""Other..."" menu option to the top level ""Run As"" menu, that would allow the user to choose from all shortcuts (similar to the ""File > New > Other..."" option). This would mean that all shortcuts would be available from all perspectives, in the event that a shortcut has not been added to all relevant perspectives.It does not address the issue of making the context ""Run"" menu and top level ""Run As"" menu match. However, changing the rules now (i.e. perspective vs. context based filtering in the top level menu), would be a breaking API change (i.e. the contract we presented in 2.1 and 3.0 is perspective based filtering in the top level menu). We want to avoid any API changes. Reply from Wayne Ho:""Agreed. We were only asking to add to the menu (or even create a new one), not remove.Performance of the dynamic menu is always going to be a concern, but I think you've done a really good job of minimizing this (e.g. via checking whether the plugin is loaded, static info to enable only on certain file types, etc.), and providing very fast support in the basic contributions. If this is a concern, then the offending contributions should change their code to perform simpler checks (possibly at the expense of being enabled too often) instead of reverting back to the static menu.This will break down in products like WSAD or IE. Do we really want a submenu with 20+ items on it, 18 of which don't apply to the selection? I don't think adding the static information in more places is the right way to go. You've come up with a much better and more powerful solution with the dynamic menus - lets make use of it here.How about even adding the Run > menu into the Run menu? It's ugly, but would get us past the current issue."" Darin Wright:""My proposal would be to do the following: combine the ""static"" with ""dynamic"" in the top level ""Run As >"" menu.The ""Run As >"" menu would be filled as follows:* For any shortcut that has a relevant ""perspective attribute"", it will be added to the menu (i.e. just as before)* For any shortcut that does not have a relevant ""perspective attribute"" (i.e. missing, or not the same as current perspective), context information will be usedEffectively, this adds any shortcuts that have context information claiming that the current selection is valid for the shortcut. Old shortcuts containing the ""old"" perspective attributes would remain visible. Note, this means the menu can be large when plugins have not  yet been activated (since we do not fully evaluate context conditions when a plug-in is not active).Would this be sufficient/happy?"" Wayne Ho:""Combining ""static"" with ""dynamic"" in the top level ""Run As >"" menu is good and resolves the problem where some relevant shortcuts may not appear on the Run As> menu.  So your proposal is an improvement.So the solution will ensure the ""Run on Server"" (or other relevant shortcut) will be available in the Run pulldown, but we still have the usability issue that the user may encounter a very large Run As> menu.Users of RWD (Web Developers) often make use of the pulldown menus (rather than context menus) and discovering the ""Run on Server"" shortcut is still a usability problem.  Especially considering in most cases the user is only interested in the Run on Server shortcut.The ""Run>""context menu does an excellent job in filtering irrelevant shortcuts, and it would be great to leverage this filtering in the Run pulldown as well. I propose that we follow your proposal to combine the ""static"" and ""dynamic"" in the top level ""Run As >"" menu, but consider organizing the menu so that users first see the ""dynamic"" context-filtered shortcuts, and then see the ""static"" shortcuts in a additional cascade menu.  For example:Run As> Run on Server        Other>        Java Applet                      Java Application                      Java Bean                      JUnit Test                      WebSphere v5.0 Application Client                      WebSphere v5.1 Application Client                      WebSphere v6.0 Application ClientIdeally, ""static"" and ""dynamic"" menus would not be duplicated.This proposal would provide the improved usability enhancement of filtering, while still displaying shortcuts added to the perspective (but may not be relevant to the current selection).Thoughts?  Comments? I like the proposal in that the contextual launch options will appear first in the menu, but I have a couple concerns:(1) A shortcut such as ""Runtime Workbench"" that does not supply context info will never appear in the first cascade, which is important to plug-in developers. It seems bad to hide this as in a second level cascade menu (and might be a usability issue).(2) Deep menus (but, perhaps this is OK since the usability has actually improved to have relevant shortcuts first) The following technical issues remain:(1) A top-level shortcut is designed to launch a selection or an active editor. Context shortcuts work only with a selection. The issue is, what do we do when an editor is active, and the top level ""Run As >"" menu is displayed?(2) Top-level shortcuts can also provide ""enablement"" XML, which we could interpret as context information. For example, the PDE shortcut provides an enablement expression that makes it appear even when the selection is empty. *** Bug 28885 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** I have experimented with a the ""Run As >"" cascade menu, combining the context & static (perspective) entries into a context menu and a ""other > "" menu. In general it works, but for 3.0.1, it has the following problems:1) It requires the introduction of a new NLS message ""Other"". TVT testing & translation has ended today.2) The menu layouts for 3.0 and 3.0.1 would be different (doesn't seem like a good incremental patch)3) There are corner cases that need work: a) when there are no applicable context entries, b) when there is one ""other"" entry, etc.Looking forward to 3.1, I would suggest we just do as the bug report suggests, and make the top level menu the same as the context menu. As well, I would move the ""Run..."" and ""Debug..."" actions into the cascasde menu, and do away with the ""other >"" option. Thus, if there is no appicable context shortcut, ""Run..."" can be chosen to create a launch config of the appropriate kind. I also suggest this change wait for 3.1, as it is a behavior and UI change. Thank you for doing the experimentation with the ""Run As >"" cascade menu.  Iunderstand your concerns with the ""other >"" menu alternative.However, addressing the usability issues related to the bug  is very importantfor the Atlantic timeframe and products such as RWD that will sit on top of 3.0.1.  Is it possible to step up to resolving this issue in time for 3.0.1?  Keeping inmind your 3 concerns with the ""other >"" menu alternative, would it be possibleto step up to the following alternative?Alternative 2:The ""Run As>"" menu to be organized so that users first see the ""dynamic""context-filtered shortcuts first followed by a separator, and then see the""static"" shortcuts below.  Launch shortcuts should not be repeated in the staticlist, if possible.Run As> Run on Server        ------------- (separator)        Java Applet        Java Application        Java Bean        JUnit Test        WebSphere v5.0 Application Client        WebSphere v5.1 Application Client        WebSphere v6.0 Application ClientThe above alternative would help ""bubble-up"" the important context-sensitive /relevant launch shortcuts.  It would not require the introduction of a new NLS""other"" message.  It resolves the problem of the corner cases you discussed.  Italso removes our concern about the ""Run-time Workbench"" launch shortcutappearing buried under the ""Other>"" menu for plug-in developers.With respect to making changes to the menu between 3.0 and 3.0.1 my feeling isthis is justified when considering the Atlantic products will be building on topof 3.0.1.  If we do not address the issues, we will continue to have a serioususability issue for launching within products such as RWD. I have experimented with the suggested approach, which works as follows:* Any applicable shortcuts that have context information and *NO* perspective information are placed in the ""Run As >"" menu* Any shortcuts that have relevant ""perspective"" information are placed in the ""Run As >"" cascade (after a separator), irrelevant of context infomation.This approach has the smallest impact on the menu - performance wise and appearance wise. The Eclipse SDK does not appear any different, as the shortcuts provided by the SDK have perspective information.Implementors wishing to take advantage of the ""context"" support in the top level ""Run As >"" menu should contribute the shortcut with no perspective infomration, and its context information will be used to determine when it appears in the menu.Does this meet the needs of the products? (i.e. can the shortcuts avoid using perspective attributes - which will override the context information?) Created attachment 13849proposed patch to org.eclipse.debug.ui After more experimentation, we find that the ""context sensitive"" solution in the top level run menu is not ideal for the following reasons:* items in the menu change order, making the accelerators assocaited with an item (number) dynamic* a seperator appears in the menu, but the user does not understand what the seperator meansFor this reason, we propose a temporary fix for 3.0.1 that allows the shortcuts to control oder in the Run menu by specifying a ""path"" attribute in the launch shortcut extension. Shortcuts are grouped by the path attribute, and then sorted alphabetically within each group. The ""null"" (default) group is sorted last. This ordering will apply to the top level ""Run As"" menus as well as the context menu. Created attachment 13912patch for ""path"" attribute group & sort Released to 3.0.1.

I made one change for the 8 p.m. build.  The change was in WorkbenchCommandSupport, and dealt with how the internal command structure responded to part activation.  It did not change the nature of part activation itself.  What necessitated the change?  Since it was working before, it seems like thereis a deeper problem with part activation.  Does the change/workaround you madeshed any light on this? Nick, I don't think I understand.  The problem that I fixed was local to commands.  There was a second fix to editor workbook, which I'm not sure I can explain fairly.  But, as it was, both of these fixes went into the 8 p.m. build -- not the 4 p.m. build.  This test failure was detecting while making the 4 p.m. build.  Nick: An error was introduced last week in command/handler processing by the keybindings in dialogs work. This error was the cause of a number of bugs (about 6in my list) related to keys running handlers in wrong parts. The error yesterdaywas clear and the fix is sound.The second fix (in EditorWorkbook) was to tell the editor presentation tosetActive(false) when it was deactivated. This change affects rendering of theeditor presentation only, and you will notice that the editor tab now draws as'inactive' when you select a view. (the 'third state' for editor tabs is stillmissing, but i feel that showing 'inactive' is much better than showing 'active'in this case for today)Both of these problems, especially when combined, suggested a fundamentalproblem with part activation but in both cases were really something much lessscary.It is possible (almost certain) tat there are still problems related to focus,I'll be assessing these (along with others, stefan, etc.) today. Thanks for clarifying.  Doug, are you still seeing the test failure on your machine?I'll have a look at it on Windows and make sure that the activation sequence ishappening properly. fyi. the command/handler bug is bug 55651. This test failure does not recur with I200403240800 and the latest from HEAD  (at this moment).  It has not recurred in the build test suites, and it hasn't  proved to be reproducible on my machine either.    Perhaps we should keep this open for a week or two, just in case it recurs.   Then it would be safe to close.   OK This hasn't reoccurred.  Closing.

55735	[Progress] Double-clicking on statusline progress icon has no effect	build I20040323If I double-click on the animated progress icon in the status line, it does notopen the progress view.  Clicking on the label does.  The whole progressindicator should be responsive to double-click. This is a limitation of the progress indicator (see Bug 55756).Double click is enabled on the progress text entry We need to restore the mouse listeners. This is going to open the new user dialog if the item shown is a user item otherwise it will open the progress view Do you really want the meaning of double-click here to differ depending on whenthe user clicks it?   No - if they are looking at all of thier actions in the progress dialog (i.e. in new user mode) we would give them that. If they turn it off we would give them a progress view. Fixed. I removed the reference to the progress indicator and now work with a progress bar directly so that I can tie in this event.Double click now opens the new user dialog it is a user job and that preference is true, otherwise it opens the progress view as before., I thought we agreed that the behaviour wouldn't depend on the currently showing job. 	2013-11-02 06:14:56	1383390000.0	resolved fixed	7ee1275	1383690000.0	java/org/apache/jasper/compiler/Validator.java java/org/apache/jasper/runtime/PageContextImpl.java test/org/apache/jasper/compiler/TestParser.java test/org/apache/jasper/compiler/TesterValidator.java test/org/apache/jasper/runtime/TesterPageContextImpl.java

In these cases some kind ofprotection would be good, such as canceling and joining your background event inyour own plugin shutdown to ensure that it never continues to run after yourplugin.shutdown() has exited.I think ResourcesPlugin.getWorkspace spec should be updated to reflect this. I have updated the ResourcesPlugin.getWorkspace spec to say it returns null ifthe resources plugin has been shut down. You shoulnd't have to do null checksevery time you access the workspace, as long as you clean up your backgroundthreads before shutting down your plugin. We currently don't have a mechanism for identifying all of the plugin's job. But this could be done and then shutdown in the plug-in should clean-up.

55656	[RCP] [ViewMgmt]  want to have the possibility to dynamically change the tab name of the view for multiple view instances	"Note: this patch added the following new APIs:IPresentablePart.PROP_PART_NAMEIPresentablePart.PROP_CONTENT_DESCRIPTIONThese were added since the presentation needs to be notified of changes to theseproperties and it shouldn't be referring directly to the workbench's constant pool.IWorkbenchPartReference.getPartName()IWorkbenchPartReference.getContentDescription()These were added to allow the workbench to access the new properties ofIWorkbenchPart2 without downcasting the IWorkbenchPartReference to aWorkbenchPartReference. on Eclipse RCP V3.0M7, it is possible to open dynamically multiple instances of a view :   showView ( String view Id, String secondary Id, int mode)the text shown in the tab of the view is tne name of the view defined in plugin.xml ( <view name="".."" ). When you open several instances of a view, all of the tabs show this text.The problem is that it is not possible to modify programmatically this text.It is possible to see it but not to change it :   IViewpart.getViewSite().getRegisteredName() gives the name of the viewIs it possible to have the setRegisteredName (String name) function ?? Investigate for M9. Matt, you're probably interested in this too. We have added IViewPart2 defining new properties getPartName() and getStatusText(), and specifying property id(s) for notifying about changes to these (currently using PROP_TITLE, but we may change to have separate ids).Stefan to complete the implementation and hook this up to the presentations. *** Bug 56304 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** Just to be clear: setPartName will change the tab text in presentations that usetab folders, including the default one. How about setDescription instead of setStatusText?

I can't see how this is relatedto my patch, but I'm CC'ing doug since I think the test is his.It would be nice (although extremely unlikely) if this could make it in fortonight's build. Are you using a recent integration build and sync'ed with head?  Fixes/changes went in recently, so you need >=I200405181622.  The patch is extensive enough that I'd want to go over it with you.I did notice that the spec for WorkbenchPage.setContentDescription still talksin terms of ""status text"" though. And IWorkbenchPart2.getContentDescription too. Some preliminary comments on the patch:WorkbenchPartReference:- Should use Util.safeString in getPartName() and getContentDescription().ViewFactory:- The getViewState method and callers are ignoring secondaryId (this wasn'tbeing handled properly before either)  - it would be better if getViewState took the IViewReference as the arg, andused ViewFactory.getKey for the map key- In saveViewState it casts down to ViewReference.  \ I'd just as soon addgetPartName() to IWorkbenchPartReference.  - Presumably this should be persisted for editors as well. It would also help to have some documentation, at least in the implementation ifnot in the spec, on the automatic updating and interplay between partName, titleand contentDescription. Nick, thanks for looking this over at such a late hour. These are all goodsuggestions.FYI, the title is persisted for editors too (at least, it's supposed to be <g>). Note: some of the subtleties of the title behavior can only be observed in theR21 presentation. Fixed in head IWorkbenchPartReference.getContentDescription() and getPartName() should be marked @since 3.0The comments for EditorPart.setPartName and setTitle, and for ViewPart.setContentDescription and setTitle should be reviewed. These are protected methods overriding methods declared on WorkbenchPart. Do these methods need/deserve specs at all?

Create or put a Managed Make project under version control.You will be prompted to add the Project files.2. Add a class.  You will be prompted to add the CPP/H files.3. Build it.  You will be prompted to add the Release or Debug directorieswith all of the generated Makefile fragments and subdirectories within.EXPECTED: All of the Release or Debug directories should typically notbe added to ClearCase or CVS.Excerpted from the Eclipse Help pages:  Any resource marked as derived will be automatically ignored for version  management by Team CVS. Some builders, such as the Java builder, mark all of   its build output (e.g. .class files) as derived.This solution also works for ClearCase.  It is alsoa cleaner solution I think to the problem of randomly-named configurations/directories.  (The other two inferior suggestions are .cvsignore and Prefs > Team > Ignored Resources) Assigning to Sean. Well, I have flagged these directories as derived. I don't know if this will solve the problem completely though. Yes, it fixes the problem nicely, verified in 3.0M8.For the record, the ClearCase plugin is listening to the creationof new resources by Eclipse.  If Eclipse marks the new resourcesas ""Derived"", the ClearCase plugin ignores the new resource and theuser does not get prompted for ""Do you want to add these to ClearCase?""In the case of Generated Makefiles, that's what we want.The ClearCase plugin is not aware of the object files and executablescreated by the compiler because Eclipse does not create them.Again, that's what we want.Thanks Sean.

55582	[Sharing Wizard] Must improve handling of failed communications	Currently, if failures occur while populating a page, the next page is shown even though it's contents are not available. We need to override WizardDialog to prevent the next page from being shown.Also, MVM saw some weirdness involving infinite prompts with invalid repo specs. This should be tested thouroughly. Unfortunately, we cannot modify the wizard dialog for CVS because it leaves in Team. However, we can return null from getNextPage to avoid transitioning. Therefore, errors will result in a prompt and no transition.As for the wierdness witnessed by MVM, that was caused by a misinterpretation on my part. It is strange, however, that it ever worked. While fixing this bug, I noticed another thing that should have never worked but did before. It turns out that there is different behavior when there is a single provider or multiple providers. I don't think there is much we can do about it though. It also turns out that the problem case is when there is one provider so its not an issue for other providers since CVS is always there.

46727	Allow quick-correct Rename to fix Error tokens	When cutting & pasting or manually refactoring code, symbol name mismatches will often result in the same token being repeatedly marked as in error.Automated 'bulk' renaming for such tokens would be highly desirable, but Ctrl-1 Quick Rename is not offered/ functional in such situations. Request: Quick Rename is my most favored tool and I would like to have it usable at all times. Perhaps even on its own key.Minor comment: perhaps it's because I haven't saved/ compiled the file, but the quick fix offers only class methods and variable-creation fixes; the obvious parameter and local variable which would be the most obvious fixes are not offered. Too many alternatives for one keystroke where the only useful only (quick rename) is not available.Quick Rename is pretty good. I like it (and want it) for use as a more powerful general 'local symbol reassigner' rather than just an occasional error-fix. eg to reassign method functionality from 'paramX', to method-calculated 'localX', to 'this.x', to 'infoObject.x', etc. There's solid use for this and we need something quicker than global refactorings.Quick While Quick Rename would be effective if the tokens were correctly resolvable, and would be the idealto reassign such referencesoccur though a correctly-typed and usable symbol exists Local rename now also works on tokens with errors: It will rename all related names.The 'Change to XX' quick fix has also been updated to not only change theselected name, but all related.> 20031222I'm not sure if I understood the second paragraph correctly.

This sounds really great, Martin, and the improvements to 'Change to Xx' fix will be really helpful also.What I was saying in the second paragraph, is often I already have a parameter or local variable of correct type or similar name, which is what the incoming code should be attached to; but that the options offered seemed to commonly miss these.Looking forward to trying your improvements out soon, we just have to overcome a small plugin problem in moving to 3m6.

Does this file build?  What encoding do you have it set to? Tanya ... what encoding is the file in that you are testing with?  No it doesn't build, but that's the compiler's problem. Eclipse however, should be able to display unicode characters in all views. On windows the German locale has the same code page as English, Latin 1 or cp1252, but the characters ß , ä and ö are in the Latin-1 supplement range U+0080-U+00FF which are beyond ascii. Copied Dave onto this.I am still working on the overall 'solution' for this type of problem.  By saying that 'its the compiler's problem' you are not providing any means for users to figure out why their tools do not work with what they are typing into the editor.  There is a set of encodings that the Gnu toolchain supports ... there is a set of encodings that our editor should be able to support : we need to make sure that the problems that arise from these encodings being different are __fully__ traceable.   FYI if I set my locale to German (on Windows XP) and have the text editor's input to UTF-8 (instead of Cp1252, the default), if I type int Lißä(){} into a new file, it looks OK.  Save and Close the file, open it up again and I get: int Li&#65533;&#65533;(){}  Anyway, the C++ Spec says that only UCN's are allowed for escaped characters in identifiers.  Setting priority low, but accepting 2.0 timeframe. BTW, the UTF-8 bug affects only the C Editor, and not the Java Editor.   > BTW, the UTF-8 bug affects only the C Editor, and not the Java Editor.I do not have the C std at hand but Are you allowed to have non-ascii7 bits characters in things like identifier names etc ...Java is a different beast, since it is UTF Read between the lines Alain, there's some bureaucracy at play here!""Fix"" applied to HEAD.  Hope I can forgive myself someday ...  No Alain, the standard says that non-ascii identifiers are accepted only as the unicode value \uxxxx or \Uxxxxxxxx. However, the outline view and other clients of the parser should do its best to display what the editor shows, not what the compiler expects (IMHO), as it does for uncompilable code anyway.Thanks, John. verified in 2.0.0.48 "	2012-01-30 10:46:47	1327940000.0	resolved fixed	b284611	1378980000.0	java/org/apache/catalina/valves/CometConnectionManagerValve.java

The following was taken from the testing matrix given to verify Eclipse:*** Description:Finish*** Test Case:7.7.2.1.3*** Actions:Check JUnit project and press ""Finish""*** Desired Results:A new file """"plugin.xml"" is added to the project tree*** Results:Fail.*** Details:It adds a .jar file instead.NOTE: perhaps the testing matrix is incorrect? I've been forwarding these reports to the various component owners, but I thinkthat your testing matrix isn't totally applicable to 3.0 stream builds.Also note that I've never seen this testing matrix, so I (and probably the othercomponent owners) can't reproduce many of these reports without more completesets of steps.  I don't know which component to move this report to because theActions section gives no context. I cannot attach the testing matrix because the file is too large, and I don't have any web space that is accessible outside of our intranet. so, if anyone would like to see the entire matrix (it's an Excel spreadsheet) please email me at lmcwil@us.ibm.com. Thanks.Sorry about this. I did not create the testing matrix, and I'm trying to get ahold of an updated version, but so far my efforts have been unsuccessful.

55469	Runtime Workbench launcher should expose boostrap entries	Up until now, the runtime workbench launcher never had the need to expose the bootstrap entries to the user.  This is because the only entry necessary is the location of the Main class, and PDE takes charge of looking for this class in the workspace/target platform and locating the right one.When launching a runtime workbench with a profiler such as Yourkit, a JAR needs to be added to the bootstrap classpath entries.  Therefore, we need to expose a text field in the launcher so that the user can add these entries, and we would just append them to the PDE-computed value. Fixed.Nick, as of next week's I-build, we will be discontinuing your weekly supply of hacked up JARs <g>.

Initially, PDE activity is disabled.Although Welcome could enable PDE activity before showing the topic, this is not desirable. Users could enable a bunch of activies by clicking on various overviews in Welcome before setting their foot in the workbench.We can do several things:1) Acknowledge that the user wants to know more about the documents that belong to the currently disabled activity and temporarily suspend filtering for that particular activity2) Not expand the TOC initially, but do it when the tool bar button is pressed3) Show these topics and the book itself in gray or some other (different) color to emphasise that they are currently disabledEither way, it would be nice if we handle this (at least partially) for M8. Sorry, this is Help. The problem also exist when synchronizing to topic that was reached by links from another document, or when openning help to a given book without even passing a topic.  Something needs to be done for 3.0.1) issues: ""temporary"" is undefined; topic may be from TOC belong to multiple activities; topic may exist mutliple times in the navigation; if book is composed from multiple TOCs, the filtering would need to be suspended for all TOCs in the topic hierarchy which is difficult2) does not make it any easier3) nice improvement over 1)I think doable for 3.0 is to take advantage of ""Show All Topics"" functionality (button) recently released.  If the topic requested is not found in TOCs from enabled activities, we can offer to show all topics.  The dialog presenting the question can display a warning about dangers of seeing all topics - similar to one presented when user presses the ""Show All Topics"" button themselves.Is this a reasonable solution? Fixed.  If topic exists in the navigation model, but navigation is filtered such that it cannot be found when displayed in the browser, a dialog asking if ""Show All"" should be enabled is presented, and user choice executed.

Maybe onWin2k COLOR_TITLE_BACKGROUND_GRADIENT maps to COLOR_WIDGET_BACKGROUND. I wouldn't stick with that choice.  For all you know that color could be hot pink.  Even on Win2K, there are tons of different color schemes available, and i'm sure not all of them use widget_background. colours for R3.0 have been decided and shipped  AFAIK, this bug is fixed. 	2013-08-05 02:53:29	1375690000.0	resolved fixed	135e2c4	1376600000.0	java/org/apache/catalina/realm/JNDIRealm.java
55357	templates do not appear in content assist when expected	Occasionally the fileset template does not appear in the content assist when expected. Sometimes it reappears after a short delay. Template proposals are presented immediately after CTRL-SPACE, however once theuser begins typing additional text and the type-ahead feature kicks in, thetemplate proposals disappear. Another CTRL-SPACE brings them back. This is because TemplateProposal returns false for ICompletionProposalExtension2#validate(IDocument, int, Document).The same happens for templates in the Java Editor.Tom, do you know the plans here? Darin, you're right. This is really a dup of bug 41750, I'll add some commentsthere.*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 41750 *** I would recommend reopening this bug and fixing it in the ant editor ASAP (I am volunteering) since it is marked as 3.0 p2, unless Tom thinks that there is a very high probability that this going to make it in before the end of M9. Sure...see what you can do. With the latest changes from text I believe that the issue described in myoriginal bug report has been corrected, thought it might be worthwhile to haveanother set of eyes on this. This works for me on both 0504 & 0511 but it appears to have regressed in HEAD,though I still haven't found files in HEAD more recent than 0511 to blame it on.Ideas? I am still seeing trouble here.I type in <propCTRL+Spacetype 'e'the property template disappears. Nothing more planned for 3.0 Reopening We can investigate using the support added via bug 41750. The remaining problem we have in Ant is that we want to validate on bothprop and <prop.I could achieve this by overriding validate(IDocument, int, DocumentEvent) but then I would need protected access to the fTemplate and getReplaceOffset.Another proposal would be to provide a protected method such as getValidationString() that TemplateProposal would implement as fTemplate.getName() and we could override as needed (would still need access to fTemplate).Comments from Tom? I favor the first proposal of comment 12: the CompletionProposal's template andthe getReplace{Offset,EndOffset} methods should be made accessible for subclasses.I filed bug 74506 against platform-text to track that request.  Changes to AntTemplateProposal and AntEditorCompletionProcessor. Comment #8 contains the test case.This fix currently depends on the latest code from jface text.

55316	[osgi] Align EclipseStarter and Launcher	Sure a minor issue, but I didn't want to end up fogetting this...It looks like EclipseStarter should not be in theorg.eclipse.core.runtime.adaptor. As far as I could see, it is completelyindependent on the framework adaptor in use. The current situation suggests thecontrary. yes.  We could consider breadking out the launchers into a separate place.  In the end we would have to consider yet another jar in the OSGi bundle.  This may just turn out to be too much to handle.Visit this issue early in M9 Note that lately a direct dependency has been introduced in the EclipseAdaptor:  EclipseStarter#startup(,)now says something like:  ((EclipseAdaptor) adaptor).setLog(log);Maybe an adaptation of the Adaptor is required here. Tom, what did we decide (if anything) we would do in this area? We wanted to remove any links between the EclipseStarter and the EclipseAdaptor so that we could move this class out.  I think that my mean we need to add some new methods to the Adaptor API to allow FrameworkLog setting and possibly some other things. Moving to Tom and pushing out/removing the milestone.  This is not urgent and should be completely hidden. Removing M9, this will not get done in time. not for 3.0 EclipseStarter is now even more tightly couple with the eclipse adpator and the default adaptor has a Launcher class. I think we should make sure both are consistents in the way they deal with arguments and it might worse trying to create only one class.

55287	Classpath issue	"found the issue - my bad :-)the issue was that the 4 jars that i mentioned, were such that 3 of themoccurred before the JRe lib container, and the US_export_policy jar occurredAFTER the JRE library container. Also, since the jars that I had from my projectwere signed using a different algorithm, the US export policy jar could not be""accessed"".So, now finally I can upgrade to M8!!! But the question would still be: why did this work with the integration buildthat i mentioned in my original bug comment? this works for me after i rearranged the project classpath. Closing hi,I was using Eclipse (Version: 3.0.0, Build id: 200403100800) till yesterday.When I downloaded (Version: 3.0.0, Build id: 200403170800). I am running aWindows XP machine with the JDK 1.5.0 beta. My project though uses the JDK1.4.2_03 version to compile and the launch configs also uses the same 1.4.x JDK.In the project classpath, I have the following jars in the classpath:jce1_2_2.jar, sunjce_provider.jar (in that order) followed by theorg.eclipse.jdt.launching.JRE_CONTAINER line. With the older (200403100800)eclipse version, i am able to run fine, but with the later one, the launch isnot able to get to the javax.crypto.Cipher class (from the jce1_2_2 jar) and soour authentication mechanism fails.Could this be resolved easily? Move to JDT/Debug Needs investigation for M8. some more info: the jdk/jre installs that i use are just plain vanilla versions- ie none of the jars/java.policy/java.security files have been updated. But what is jce1_2_2.jar? It is not part of my JDK vanilla install? The sunjce_provider.jar will appear on the bootpath by default (as will all jars in the ext directory). Why are you adding them explicitly? Continue to investigate, but does not look like an M8 stop ship. What happens if you place the jars in the 'ext' directory of the JRE and the launch with nothing extra on your bootpath, but the ""JRE System Libaray""? I tried that - but then i get some error message saying ""could not verifycertification"" (or something like that - sorry i dont have the exact messageright now).But, my question would be: why would this stop working if i just upgraded theeclipse version? I was using the same JDK/JRE with the earlier version - and itworked fine).I also tried using the jars that are present in the JDK/JRE by not putting themin the project classpath (.classpath file) - and the whole thing works with bothversions of eclipse, presumably because the jre container entry in the.classpath file has all the jars from the lib\ext directory included in it. i just tried 3.0 M8 (with the vanilla version of the JDK/JRE), and got this:Caused by: java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException: Cannot find any providersupporting DESede	at javax.crypto.Cipher.getInstance(DashoA6275)i will try the suggestion from comment <a href=""https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=55287#c6"">#6</a> ok - once i replaced all the jars in the JRE with the ones from my project lib,i get the following error:Caused by: java.lang.SecurityException: Cannot set up certs for trusted CAs:java.security.PrivilegedActionException: java.net.MalformedURLException: no protocol: US_export_policy.jar	at javax.crypto.SunJCE_b.<clinit>(DashoA6275) sorry for bothering - but is there any progress on this bug? i am unable to moveto any later builds due to this defect. If you require any config files (likethe .classpath and/or the .launch file), i would be happy to attach them to this bug is this in any way related to bug 56665? I don't know how to reproduce your problem. I'm able to run the example fromhttp://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/security/jce/JCERefGuide.html#Exampleswithout problem.Can you provide a small test that shows the problem ?I don't understand why you add jce1_2_2.jar and sunjce_provider.jar to the buildpath/classpath. This 2 libraries are already part of the JRE (in 1.4.x).

Also, if eclipse is restarted with a different environment setting, the platform configuration is not regenerated with the new settings.Perhaps platform.xml could stay the same (i.e. contain all the features), and only the getPluginPath() method could change to return the appliable plugins. Fixed the configuration parser to skip features whose environment data does not match the current environment. 	2013-07-10 00:35:33	1373430000.0	resolved fixed	95ee699	1373560000.0	java/org/apache/coyote/http11/AbstractHttp11Processor.java
55207	Merge does not see files/dirs deleted in stream where changes come from	I'm using build I200403171300.I want to merge a specific stream (branch JDK_1_5) of a project starting from the version where the branch was created (Root_JDK_1_5) with changes made in HEAD stream.After the merge is done, I can see all created and modified files displayed in synchronize view but not files (or dirs) which were deleted in HEAD...Set severity to major as it's really painful to identify each time I merge (every 2 days) all files deleted in HEAD stream and delete them manually in my JDK_1_5 workspace after the merge... I am no able to reproduce this failure. What CVS server version are you using? Is there an easy way to see that or do I have to ask my sysadmin? You can determine that using the cvs command line using the following command (using dev.eclipse.org as an example   cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@dev.eclipse.org:/home/eclipse versionYou may need to do the following first if you need a password to access the server   cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@dev.eclipse.org:/home/eclipse login The CVS server version being used was no supported The version I have on my box is:d:\usr>cvs -versionConcurrent Versions System (CVS) 1.9.28 (client)Copyright (c) 1989-1998 Brian Berliner, david d `zoo' zuhn,                        Jeff Polk, and other authorsCVS may be copied only under the terms of the GNU General Public License,a copy of which can be found with the CVS distribution kit.Specify the --help option for further information about CVS Michael,Talking with my sysadmin, it seems that I get wrong version number for cvs...The version of our server we use in Saint-Nazaire is:$ cvs -d :pserver:jcn@snz1f:/data/cvs/eclipse versionClient: Concurrent Versions System (CVS) 1.12.5 (client/server)Server: Concurrent Versions System (CVS) 1.11.1p1 (client/server)I guess it is supported, doesn't it? Yes, the version is supported. However, I have not been able to reproduce this. Does it happen every time for you? If so, could you give a percise set of steps to reproduce. As I said initially you need to have another branche than HEAD: JDK_1_5 in our repository.This problem occurs every time for me and especially when we rename classes or move some from one package to another one.So, the test case could be:1) In a workspace on HEAD, I rename a class and/or move a class from a package to another one2) I release my change in HEAD stream3) In a workspace on JDK_1_5, I merge differences between HEAD and JDK_1_5 starting from common version (Root_JDK_1_5)4) I can see in Synchronize view new classe (renamed and/or moved) as input changes, but cannot see the deleted classe(s)...Note that it is not exactly the scenario I use during my merge. In step 3 I just perform a refresh of the already stored merge. It is not possible to restart the merge from scratch each time as the branch exists since October and may have more than 1500 conflicts...Note also that this happens on classe(s) which are in conflict during the merge (ie. modified in both streams)...Hope this help I suspect the last point is the key (i.e. previously merged deletion). I will try to reproduce this shortly. I have been able to reproduce this. It involves files that wee added to HEAD since the branch was created, caught up to on the branch and then later deleted from HEAD. Fix released to HEAD. A new test case has also been added for this case. 	2013-07-07 01:11:30	1373170000.0	resolved fixed	6c54031	1373480000.0	java/org/apache/jasper/compiler/JspDocumentParser.java

55218	[DND] pen users inadventently dragging and dropping parts	"Build I20040316I've notice I've been accidentally splitting editor windows and views a lot lately (couple of times a day). This never used to happen to me.I use a pen (stylus) rather than an mouse. Us pen users are much more likely to issue ""slurred"" mouse presses rather stationary ones; i.e., the mouse up event location is usually different from where the corresponding mouse down event happened.What's happening to me is this: I click on the ""Problems"" tab to bring it to the fore. But my slur while hitting the tab is interpreted as dragging the Problems view and placing it above the view stack. A similar thing happens to me with editors when I go for the little chevrons: I end up splitting the editor pane.As I mentioned, this is a new mistake that I'm making with the UI. Hopefully something can be done to make the workbench UI less error-prone for pen users. I believe that this was caused by the same problem as bug 55099: the SWTDragListener was being used instead of our custom code. In addition to bug55099, this would have also caused the drag hysterisis to become very small.Fixed in head this morning.

For example, UltraEdit and MS Word change the context first.

55183	Preference to switch perspective on suspend is too eager	"The preference to switch perspectives ""when a breakpoint is hit"" actually prompts to do so every time the program suspends. It should only respond to suspension for breakpoints. Not step ends, evaluation completions, etc. To see how this was a problem, set the preference to ""prompt"", then debug to a breakpoint and do some stepping. Answer ""No"" (repeatedly).Suspending for a breakpoint is different than suspending for a step because step suspension is more explicit. The user says ""step"" and we do it right away. With breakpoints, the user doesn't necessarily know when it's going to happen so having the prompt is useful to alert them to the event. Also, hitting a breakpoint puts you into the state of ""debugging a program"" which might require switching to the Debug perspective. But with stepping, your program is already suspended, so you're already ""debugging"".Fixed in PerspectiveManager. Please verify, DarinW. Verified. There's a more subtle problem too - if I step over a line and that step encounters a breakpoint, I get prompted. Not sure we can/want to fix that.

55158	[Dialogs] Deleting resources displays a modal dialog	I20040317When I upgrade Eclipse I delete all the old binary plug-in projects and re-import them. Deleting 110 projects can take a minute or two, during which time I can't click on the Eclipse window due to the modal delete dialog. This is not a regression. It may be considered for a background task in the future. We have decided that it should not be a background task after all as there is too much going on to make the workbench useful while this is going on.

The problem is that I tried to do exactly this and I could not reproduce.I will continue to investigate. As stated the code is not yet in HEAD. Did you modify the code to reproduce? Itworks for us when we use reconcile(false /*getAST*/, ...) but not when we usereconcile(true, /*getAST*/, ...) of course it should read: ...when we use reconcile(true /*getAST*/, ...) I tried to create an AST out of this compilation unit resolving the bindings forit and it worked. So far, I was unable to reproduce it. I will send you a plug-in export of JDT UI this morning where you can see this. The bug is in the reconcile working copy operation.ReconcileWorkingCopyOperation Line 71, the call to process will clean up thecompilation unit. This clean up resets the scopes to null. But afterwards, theDOM/AST is created with binding resolution and this expects the scope to beavailable.So no scope are available when the getKey() is called on the bindings and thisleads to a NPE.The scope must be cleaned after the DOM/AST creation, not before. Changed ReconcileWorkingCopyOperation as well as CompilationUnit.buildStructure() to cleanup the compilation unit declaration only after building the AST.Added regression tests ASTConverterTest2.test0538f() and test0538g() Thanks for the quick responcse.

For me it will 100% not show up in the package explorer - unless I close and reopen the project anfterwards. Even a refresh on the project does not change anything. Addition to that: The actual problem does not seem to be CVS. When deleting files I also get the problem, that the file icon is not removed from the package explorer. However when I rightclick on the file icon, the delete menuitem is greyed out after deletion. So the file is gone but it still does show up. Changing the title to reflect the situation correctly. Moving to JDT/UI. Eric, how do you delete the file ? Are you using the delete action from the Navigator or Package Explorer or are you deleting the file directly on the file system ? Deleting the file from withing Eclipse works for me without any problem. I delete it from within Eclipse. (context menu of the file) Erich, can you please investigate for M9. This works for me and there are no similar known problems.Can you please provide more specific information:* does it happen with any file (.java, .txt)?* can you reproduce it in a fresh project with a newly created file?* is there anything special about the file (read only), anything special about the project Ok, I could validate this bug now on M4 and M8. Example: I select Refactor -> Rename on a package declaration and choose to update references. The references are updated, the folder is moved, *but* the ""old folder"" remains visible in the package explorer - even when I ""refresh"". Only reopening the project makes it disappear. M8 showed me a question mark on the ""ghost folder"" - I am not sure if this was due to the fact that this project is a shared project or not.In general I am experiencing this with any kind of ressources, however not always, only sometimes, but then reproducably.I could not reproduce it with a fresh file. Maybe it has to do with the CVS feature. I am not sure however. Since we cannot reproduce the problem, can you reproduce it with some tracing options enabled.

It seems to really hard to track down and occur only under rare circumstances. Sean, do you think you would be able to reproduce it somehow? A couple of remarks:- I fixed a bug where deleting read-only files caused a problem.- we dicovered a bug where a wrong delta was issues when copying package. This  will be fixed for next I-Build. I can reproduce it almost everytime I delete a file.  :) Hmmm, Sean, that's interesting now since in my current version it hasn't turned up yet again. What exact revision are you using? Could you try the debug options, Erich postet? I will attach the config file... Created attachment 10460Debug options file I'll try the debug options.  I'm running M8. I also experienced this. We have read only files because of a team plug-in. Currently I'm using I20040512 and havn't found it yet in this build. Ok, I can reproduce this now 100% on M4 as follows:- Team Project checked out- Create new class in default package- Do synchronize (don't check in the class)- Delete the default package.-> The nodes fot the classes remain. On project close/reopen, they are gone. Eric, do you use Watch/Edit mode ? Eric please try to reproduce the problem on M9 @Dirk: No, I don't.@Erich: Yes, I will try asap. By the way: The debug log seemed to show nothing unusual when I reproduced it on M4. I also experienced this. I'm using M9. I was using M8, with my projects sharedin CVS. When I installed M9, and run it one time (only to see modifications)...Then I closed eclipse and copy all my projects from directory ""workspace"" to thenewly created ""workspace"" dir in M9. Then I started eclipse again and import oneproject to the new workspace. In the Java perspective I opened in the PackageExplorer the project and it showed me a lot of CVS folders like it was packages,OK, its was expected to see it. Then I go to pop-up menu and choose Team ->Share Project. OK, it have shared the project, but the CVS folders still there,even when I refresh the view it remain there. So I go to pop-up menu and chooseTeam ->  Disconnect, and on the showed window I choose ""Also delete CVS ....."".The eclipse delete it from the file system, but the CVS folders still there. Idiscovered that in the Navigator view the CVS folders aren't showed, but theremain in the Package Explorer, even with refresh. The only option is to closethe project and reopen it. This way the CVS folders are ""cleaned"" from thePackage Explorer. I think this way you can reproduce this bug.  additional fixes related to updating the package explorer (incorrect Java model deltas) went into RC1.without a reproducable case we cannot verify that this problem is fixed.keeping the bug open but moving it forward to RC2. Please try again on RC1. Erich,Can't you reproduce the bug with the instructions on comment #20 ? The issue seems to be that the JavaModel doesn't hide team private members.The CVS folders are marked as team private (IResource.isTeamPrivateMember).Team private members are supposed to be hidden from clients, but somehow the JavaModel surfaces them as resources.Clients can control whether they want to get team private members when asking for them with the constant INCLUDE_TEAM_PRIVATE_MEMBERS.Moving to JDT core - if trivial to fix then this would be a candidate for RC2. Team private members are not offered until explicitly asking for them afaik. This means we should never see these for free, and should not have to filter them ever. Suspecting some platform bug were such resources would be leaking to us.Moving to platform for further comment. I can reproduce this with M9.My steps:- copy org.eclipsec.core.runtime from my current workspace to c:\desktop- start new workspace- File -> Import -> Existing project -> c:\desktop\org.eclipse.core.runtime- switch to Java perspective-> Note that the CVS folders appear in the Packages Explorer view- context menu: Team -> Share Project -> yes use existing info-> Note that CVS folders still appear in Packages ExplorerNote:- I cannot reproduce this with today's noon build. (i0610-1200)- using M9 you can close your project and then re-open it to remove the folders- see Jeem's comments in bug 12743*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 12743 *** So am I right now that this problem is assumed to have been identified (bug #12743) and is going to be fixed before the final release of 3.0 ? There are no plans to change the current behaviour.  Please see comments inreferenced bug report. Yes, bug 12743 is classified as RESOLVED_WONTFIX at the moment. So in a nutshell that means that people will have to live with this bug (and from the user point of view, that's what it is - regardless its cause) presumably forever? Is there really no workaround? The work-around is to close and then re-open the project. Please see bug 12743 comment #2.

54964	IDEApplication.checkInstanceLocation is throwing up an error dialog	"There seems to be a problem with instanceLoc.lock() in this method in a runtimeworkbench (perhaps otherwise too?).  The .lock() method is returning false andthen the checkInstanceLocation method drops to the error dialog and then fails. The workbench cannot be started. Actually, it could be that the lock() method is throwing an exception instead ofreturning false.  Either could cause the noted behaviour. Looks like a dependency problem.  I've sent the following email to the ui dev list.  I'll leave this bug open for today, in case others run into the same problem.The newest version of IDEApplication (in org.eclipse.ui.ide) depends on the most recent versions of the runtime (that were submitted for today's integration build).  If you are manually updating your version of the UI code, you'll also need the following runtime packages:	org.eclipse.osgi	org.eclipse.osgi.services	org.eclipse.osgi.util	org.eclipse.core.runtime	org.eclipse.platformThe UI dependency is in org.eclipse.osgi, but the others will likely be used by osgi.If that is too many packages to grab, you could also try running with -Declipse.testing.ui=true, which should make the old runtime code behave as the new version does.

54961	Updating through http proxy (almost) locks PC with 100% CPU usage	"I've correctly specified the http proxy for updates, which requiresauthentication (NTLM by default, although has also worked with basic for otherapplications, Java and non-Java) on a different domain than the client or proxy.Non-NTLM authentication requires the ""AUTH-DOMAIN\username"" format for the username.As soon as the updater requires some http communication, the java process hits100% cpu usage, severely crippling other processes (i.e. they're ""as slow asmolasses in January""). This continues indefinitely unless Cancel is pressed. Can you provide a test update site that I can try to reproduce the problem? I first experienced the problem when I tried to install the Spindle plug-inthrough their update site http://spindle.sourceforge.net/updates through the""new components"" updater but I had the same results when trying the ""installedcomponents"" updater.I'm using M7 and the Sun 1.4.2 J2RE. I tried switching eclipse to the beta J2RE1.5 but I got the same.One thing to note is that I had never tried to update Eclipse before, as onlyrecently I gained access to the web, and only through the proxy. My case isunusual and rare, requiring an ISA server (the web proxy), two domains, theclient on one domain together with the server, which in turn allows access onlythrough a specific account on the second domain. There may be a less complicatedcombination that still experiences the problem, but I don't have any access totry anything.My first question would be ""why don't I get an authorization dialog?"" Can you try starting Eclipse with -console option so you get a command window and press Ctrl-Break in this window, when you get to 100%CPU point?  This should produce thread dump which can help determine what happens. See bug 37205, as they've had success with M6 and Sun JDK 1.4.2_03.Perhaps your unusual setup is not handled correctly. Constantine,-console does not seem to work when starting Eclipse from a shortcut.  Open a dos prompt, switch to directory	C:\Dev\eclipseand type	eclipse.exe -console -data C:\Dev\workspace -vm c:\j2sdk1.4.2\bin\javaw -vmargs -Xmx256Mthere.  It should work from command line. Created attachment 8648console dump resultsThis is a copy of the Ctrl-Break dump on the console. It is reformated toun-wrap line wraps (not sure if I got it right, though). BTW,The command that worked was:eclipse.exe -console -data C:\Dev\workspace -vm c:\j2sdk1.4.2\bin\java -vmargs-Xmx256M(notice the java.exe instead of javaw.exe) The console show a NPE, that leads to a loop.  I have release a fix, but was not able to reproduce the original problem.  What was the proxy host you specified?Please verify in builds nightly >20040318 or the next week integration build. The proxy is not visible outside our LAN as it is part of our firewall. I willtry to get build and test it on a separate setup. Would that satisfy you? I would still like to know how you specified the host.  Have you just typed a host name in the Update preferences, or have you specified IP, or use any other format that uncovered this problem. Sorry for the delay. Here it is:On the ""Install/Update"" page in the Preferences, I selected ""Enable HTTP proxy connection"" and specified the host by name (also tried by IP address, but no change) and the port (happens to be 8080). Thanks. - Update for M8I'm testing M8 and under the same settings I now get the following lines for""Search for updates of the currently installed features"":Unable to access ""http://update.eclipse.org/updates""  Unable to access Site stream: ""http://update.eclipse.org/updates"" [Serverreturned HTTP response code: 407 for URL: http://update.eclipse.org/updates]  Unable to access Site stream: ""http://update.eclipse.org/updates/site.xml""[Server returned HTTP response code: 407 for URL:http://update.eclipse.org/updates/site.xml]These appear in a dialog box. There were times when eclipe.org was not available.Have you tried pointing your browser to those sites and check the connection? No relation, this is a 407 ""Proxy Authentication Required"" as per RFC 2616,para. 10.4.8I have no idea why this would be unexpected by the installer/updater.BTW, sorry for ""reopening"" the bug ppl, if improper. Konrad, can you re-investigate this when you have a chance? thx My fixes in that code are shots in the dark, as I do not have access to a proxy, and cannot debug it.It would help to understand what is going on, if Constantine could you provide more guiding details:Has a fix talked in comment #8 fixed a 100% CPU original problem?The problem in comment #13, I assume it is the same proxy configuration, were you prompted for the password, typed a correct or incorrect one to get the error message?Do you know if the error prevents update from fetching updates from other sites, for example a local site (on your disk), or are you just concerned that error dialog is too imprecise and intrusive? 1. The fix mentioned in comment #8 fixed the 100% CPU problem.2. The proxy configuration is the same. I never get a chance to enter ausername/password. The error happens for other sites too. I don't know how totest with an on-disk update site.I'll be happy to fill in on any other details. Got this link from someone, it may help with settings:Link to Microsoft technote KB295667http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;295667 I have installed proxy at home and looked at the code around UpdateManagerAuthenticator:1.  If user cancels dialog once they can naver entered a password again for the same proxy - they needed to restart Eclipse.  Fixed this.2.  Most values (except the port number) obtained from Java by Authenticator.getReqesting...() can be null.  Only few are documented in JDK docs.  This can result in NPEs in UpdateManagerAuthenticator.  I have fixed one as in comment #8.  Now removed rest assumptions of not null.3.  UpdateManagerAuthenticator was attempting to always create URL from values obtained from Authenticator.  This was likely to fail.  Event if values were not null, a protocol could have been ""http/1.1"" which new URL will not accept.Upon MalformedURL UpdateManagerAuthenticator would return blank user and one space password.  If it could not handle authentication, it should return null.4.  UpdateManagerAuthenticator contained a code for retrieving, but never saving user/passwords in the Platform.  Platform stores user passwords indexed by multiple keys, one of them URL, which makes it inapropriate for keeping even proxy passwords.5.  UpdateManagerAuthenticator had a code to cache last authentication request and corresponding user/pass combination.After adding fixes and refactoring UpdateManagerAuthenticator is reduced to few lines of logic plus the dialog class.  There is really nothing left that can fail there.UpdateManagerAuthenticator had a check for authentication scheme and was only promting for password if it was ""basic"".  Recently ""ntlm"" was added.  Now the check is removed and user will be prompt for all types of autentication that JRE can handle.  I have tested ""basic"", ""digest"", ""ntlm"".There can be only one Authenticator registered in Eclipse (1 per VM).  I have made sure that UserValidationDialog is passed not null string (possibly empty).  Since UpdateManagerAuthenticator no longer tries to create URLs. it should handle authentication for password protectes sites or SOCKS proxy (there is no preference page for SOCKS proxy, but it can be configured on system properties).As for Constantine problem, it should be fixed.  If it was canceling problem it is gone.  It is also not clear what authentication scheme the proxy is using.  In original report you say: Non-NTLM authentication requires the ""AUTH-DOMAIN\username"".  I know the domain can be passed with user name for NTLM, but have not seen this format for other schemes like basic.  If your proxy was not basic and not ntlm, it could have not worked as there was a specific check for these two.Code in the builds 20040409 or newer. > Code in the builds 20040409 or newer.Shouldn't that have been 20040509?Will test ASAP. Which is better, nightly or integration?BTW, good job! Available in >=20040509.  I cannot say which will be a good build. 20040509 and 10 have (second) startup problems.  I suggest waiting for a good integration build this week. Tested with I20040512. Same results as in comment #13.Perhaps this integration build doesn't have the changes? How will I know when toget an integration build? The first integration build with the changes is I20040512 20:00. Congratulations!!! I tried I20040513 and it works!!!One thing to note is that it asks me for the username/password 2-3 times. Thatmay be intentional though...Details:Tried the Eclipse update site, it worked (no updates).Tried the Splindle update site, it didn't work (there must be a problem withthir update info, there is a parsing error).Tried the AJDT update site, it worked (download started).Comments:The Eclipse update asked 3 times for username/password. Otherwise, there were noproblemsThe AJDT update asked 2 times for username/password. At least, I think it wastwice only...Problem:After I tried the Spindle update I couldn't get the ""Find and install...""dialog. I restarted Eclipse, but it still wouldn't come up. I figured the failedupdate had caused a problem, so I wiped the workspace. The new workspace was ok,so I tried the AJDT update. I canceled the AJDT update because I couldn't waitfor it to finish, and the ""Find and install..."" dialog wouldn't come up again.The strangest thing is, when I open Eclipse and I click ""Find and install..."", Iget a couple of seconds of hourglass cursor, and then nothing. If I try again(not closing Eclipse in between), I don't get any hourglass cursor (i.e. I getnowhere fast! :) The authentication prompt comes up 2 times because the code tries to access the site first, then the site/site.xml. If you add the site as http://path/to/site/site.xml, I think you'll only get one prompt.There was a problem caused by a UI bug that will be fixed in today's 8AM build, that caused our wizard to now come up when there is a workspace from a previous run. Shouldn't there be some caching of the username/password then? It would be nice, but new code needs to be written for that.  Adding layer of caching may lead to problems.  Consider logging into a ntlm proxy that with recently changed password.  VM may attempt to:1 log-in with a password that it cached by JRE,2 then it will send some generic password,3 then it will send password it gets from Windows4 then it will ask update for a password, and update will provide a cached one,5 it will ask update again and update will pop-up a dialog that user will finally have a chance to fill in the correct password.Every password caching adds another unsuccessful login attempt.  A proxy may have a limit on number of retries and block the user out.This require more testing, beyond ensuring correctness of the code.  This bug was about getting it to work and I am satisfied if it works.  Caching is an improvement with a potential to have negative effect and we should not experiment with this for 3.0.  You may open a enhancement request that we will consider later not near the end of the release.

54178	Symptom DB editor's overall presentation could be improved	"Here are 3 fairly simple suggestions for improving the overall presentation of the symptom DB editor:1. Display a title at the top of the editor. If you look at other editors of this style (e.g. plugin.xml, build.properties, extension point schemas), there is always a title, except for the source tab.2. Do we really need the ""Overview"" tab? It doesn't give the user an overview of the symptom database, but shows the file details from the properties. If you look at the PDE's plugin.xml editor's overview, it gives an overview of what's in the other tabs, in a condensed form.3. When initially opening the editor, there is nothing selected and the right side of the editor is blank. Perhaps it would be better to initially select the symptom database (root item), to display the database's values, like name, description, etc. This way, the right side will never be blank. The reson we have the Overview tab is to delay the load of the emf model ( which can be quite slow if the model is large ).This was a problem in particular when the editor opened on single file selection, but it is still a problem on double click selection. Adriana, you can ignore #2; this one doesn't apply. All this code is in org.eclipse.hyades.sdb. Perhaps the best way to determine how to show a title (#1) is to look at other examples. The plugin.xml editor is in org.eclipse.pde.ui I think. You'll have to check this one out from the eclipse repository (dev.eclipse.org, /home/eclipse, pserver, user:anonymous, no pass).Or, I think there might be one in the org.eclipse.hyades.test.ui plugin. Have a look.For setting the initial selection, you'll need to do this on the JFace viewer that shows the tree. After it's populated, you'll have to somehow get the symptom database object and call setSelection() on the viewer. Fix submitted. Verified.

54800	dynamically importet package problems when uninstalling bundle	From Martin Lippert on the newsgroup...I tried to following:- bundle A exports a package via Export-Package.- bundle B dynamically imports that package via DynamicImport-Package.- a method of bundle B is called that creates an Object from the mentioned package.Everything works fine until I uninstall bundle A (via the console). As a resultof uninstalling bundle A (and a refresh) nothing happens to bundle B... From Jeff McAffer on the newsgroup...Hmmm, this seems like a bug.  As Pascal mentioned, dynamically importingfrom A does not affect B's ability to resolve but once B is actually runningand loading classes from A, it is dependent on A.  Uninstalling A (andrefreshing) should cause B to stop and restart.  It can restart even with Agone because it did not explicilty rely on A, it just dynamically importedstuff that happened to come from A.If I have characterized this correctly, could you enter a bug report againstEquinox/OSGi with details?  Simple test case would also be cool. Created attachment 8569test projectsZIP contains three plugins that ensemble a simple RCP application. The mainplugin (org.example.application) creates an extension (from pluginorg.example.application.ext1). This plugin dynamically imports a package thatis exportet by org.example.application.ext2.Try the following:- start the application with the -console option (ready defined launchconfiguration embedded in main plugin)- see the status report via the console. All three plugins are active, sincethe application created an instance of ext1 and ext1 created an object from thedynamically importet plugin ext2.- uninstall plugin ext2 and refresh via the console.- take a look at the status of all bundles via the console.As a result of uninstalling plugin ext2 it was removed from the status list.But nothing happened to plugin ext1 (which already used ext2 and thereforeloaded classes from ext2). This is not really a dynamic import problem.  Here is what happens in the testcase:1.  The application, ext1 and ext2 get resolved.2.  The application is started and it calls ends up calling the constructor for StartView in the sample application.3.  This code finds all the extentions to its extention point and calls createExecutableExtension on them.  This ends up calling the SampleExtention1 constuctor which ends up creating an object from the dynamically imported package from ext2.4.  The ext2 bundle is uninstalled and refresh is called.5.  The ext1 and ext2 bundles end up getting refreshed and ext1 is restarted.6.  But the code from the sample application object StartView still has a reference to the old SampleExtention1 object which still has a reference to the old dummy class exported by ext2.  So when the button in the application is pushed the old references are used.I do not understand the eclipse extension registry enough and this brings up some questions.  Should the sample application be notified when some of its extensions are refreshed so that it can clear its references to old objects?  Should UNRESOLVED events be published by the framework for bundles that are being refreshed even when the end result will be a resolved bundle?  Currently the Framework do not send UNRESOLVED events out during refresh packages unless a previously resolved bundle becomes unresolved at the end of the refresh packages operation.  In this case ext1 will end up resolved but an UNRESOLVED event will never be published so the registry will not clear out any references to the old extensions.Jeff, I think the registry will have to take this into account if it is keeping cached objects to extensions because the classloader to these objects will have been thrown away when the bundle is refreshed, regardless of whether the bundle ends up resolved or not. The bundle is refreshed as expected.  The problem is that the example is not listening for eclipse registry changes.  If it did it could get rid of references to old objects from the uninstalled bundle.There is still a problem in the registry that prevents such an example from working.  The registry does not properly listen for UNRESOLVED events in order to send out registry changed events.  see defect 55030. Yes, the example is incomplete in this point. I missed to check if the bundle isrefreshed or not. Because the framework is putting the bundle back into the oldstate, I just saw in the console that nothing happened to the bundle. Sorry forthe mistake.In the meantime I implemented a workaround for this: The application adds aBundleListener to its BundleContext to listen for started and stopped eventsfrom the bundles that the application created an extension from. In such a casethe old instances are thrown away and new executable extensions are created. The Framework has been fixed to send out proper RESOLVED/UNRESOLVED events and the elipse registry has also been updated from bug 55030 and sends out the proper events to registry listeners.  You should be able to update your example code to properly listen to registry events to add and remove extensions dynamically. 	2013-04-04 21:47:00	1365130000.0	resolved fixed	d2630df	1366730000.0	java/org/apache/tomcat/websocket/WsWebSocketContainer.java

54748	progress, background operations, and novice users	"Build I20030304There has been much discussion elsewhere about insufficiently visible progress indications for builds. I'd like to raise a more general issue about the kind of feedback that will help novice users of Eclipse. If it helps, think of my mom as the user (you can imagine that she's not too comfortable with computers<g>).The problem is that when the user performs any command that will complete sometime later in the background, whether it be build, synchronize, or whatever, she needs to know this immediately. I mean ""in your face"" immediately. A smoldering cigarette in the lower right corner of the screen does signal this to the novice user, even when accompanied by a slightly larger hover. Something as unmistakable as a 2.1 modal progress dialog is what we're talking about. The reason why its so important for the novice is that they expect the commands they give to happen in the background (a more sophisticated notion). Novice users are more familiar with simple turn-taking UIs. The other nice thing about the old progress dialogs is that they automatically went away when the operation was done, and that told the user that it was again their turn.Here's one way I could see addressing this problem:- Workbench preference ""Progress dialogs for background operations"" vs. ""No Progress dialogs for background operations"". Default value: Yes.- Background operations initiated by the user's direct command (as opposed to periodically scheduled operations like bg refreshes or indirectly triggers operations like table tree widget population) are covered by a progress dialog of the familiar size unless suppressed by that users preference.- The progress dialog is non-modal, and will close automatically when the operation is finished. The dialog reports progress on the user's direct command, and has a Cancel button. The fine print at the bottom of dialog could inform the user that they are free to wait or to do other things as they choose (i.e., it hints that it's non-modal).- If the clicks on the workbench window, the progress dialog disappears behind it, and the user can go ahead and explore.- When the operation completes, the progress dialog closes automatically whether or not it is visible.- If the operation fails, the user needs an in-you-face notification.- If the user issues another long-running command that runs in the background,an additional progress dialog should open for that operation, and disappear when it's done.If you combine this with the other progress mechanisms added in 3.0, I think we end up with something that will satisfy the needs of novices and gearheads alike. See bug 52617 for a discussion that shows that in some cases even sophistiated users need prominent confirmation of background operations starting, running, and completing. Important correction to original text:> The reason why its so important for the novice is that> they *never* expect the commands they give to happen in the> background (a more sophisticated notion).  As an example of this approach, compare with long running operations in Windows Explorer.  They open a progress dialog, but the main window is not blocked. Another good example is Symantecs popup at the bottom of the monitor that lets you know something went on in the background *** Bug 52468 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** See also bug 52468 for some good suggestions from Martin along these lines. Download managers are another example which have the added advantage of showing multiple jobs in the same window.  I can demonstrate the one in Mozilla Firefox (previously known as Firebird).Using a separate window has other advantages, e.g. showing % complete in the task tray by updating its title. I20040310If I press Save and have the option set to perform background builds on resource modification then this is a good message to see in the status bar:   Building Workspace: 5% doneBut if I do Project > Build All it's not as good because I did what I logically think of as a foreground operation but nothing obvious happens and it's hard to tell when it's done.Also the progress messages in the status bar are often hard to decipher, for example, when updating something from CVS it said:   Refreshing 'CVS ...pace': 24% done   Performing a CV...ources: 1% done   Searching for m...s view: 0% doneThere was a dialog that came up when the CVS sync was done but it was annoying so I turned it off. But now I kind of have to wait for the progress bar to stop updating and the CPU in my task monitor to go down in order to know when my update is done.Finally, the distinction between a user task and a system task is hard to understand, and I don't agree with the way they're categorized all the time. For example, Decoration calculation and Searching for markers seem like system things to me but they're marked as user. Tasks marked as user show up in the status line. Agree that decoration calculation should be a system task. This one has bugged me in the past. (the other points you make are good too. :-) ) see also bug #52471 for a discussion on the system jobs vs. user job separation. Should we differentiate between status line progres and modal dialogs? In 2.1 wemade an effort to move away from progress dialogs and instead tried using theworkbench status line to show progress. How would this effect Jim's suggestedworkflows? For example, would there be a category of operations, such as abuild, that shouldn't be shown in the non-modal progress dialog?If we can agree on some of these details IMHO we should try and do this for 3.0if the new background operations are to be useable not only for novice users (mymum included) but for everyone. A good example of the non-modal progress dialogcan be seen with Outlook. This bug isn't assigned to a milestone, is that onpurpose. Are we postponing post 3.0?  One case that's important to get right is Save.  Prior to 2.1, this brought up aprogress dialog, which if you didn't have autobuild on would just flash briefly. In 2.1, we fixed it to use the status line.  It would be a mistake to start using a dialog again for this case.Now with background builds, the user doesn't have to wait as long if autobuildis on.  But we've lost the indication of how many errors/warnings werefixed/found, unless the user goes to the Progess view or hovers over theprogress indicator. It would be nice if (some of) the status line jobs started as modal jobs with a""[always] minimize to status line"" option so novice (or migrating 2.1) users can(1) get a feel for the jobs that are taking up CPU and (2) learn about thestatus line. One thing that really confused me as an upgrading 2.1 user (to 3.0M7) was thebackgrounded CVS checkout. I ended up checking out my project 3 or 4 timesbefore I noticed the process meter in the bottom right. My first assumption wasthat something was broken in the IDE because I didn't get any foregroundfeedback to my input. Had there been a dialog I would known that eclipse wasprocessing my request and I could have also backgrounded it (and all future CVSdialogs) and would never have been confused. I don't see this as a P4 problem. Several teams (notably both Team and JDT) have been adding workarounds for this issue in their code. If this is not fixed, then the we risk having a number of inconsistent solutions. We need to decide what if anything is to be done within the M9 timeframe (preferably very early in M9).Anything not done by M9 will have to be deferred to 3.1. This will be resolved early in the M9 timeframe I have added a new ""user job"" flag to jobs.  Job.isUser() should return trueonly for jobs that were directly initiated by user action, and for which theuser may reasonably want to wait for completion rather than continuing to work.I anticipate that this new flag can be used to decide for which jobs we openthis progress dialog. I suggest that all build jobs can be the initiate set of""user"" jobs to prototype this.  If successful, we could then begin to mark otherjobs (such as explicitly requested CVS operations) as user jobs. John, what's the vision for the relationship between:a. the large progress indicator in the status bar (the one with a proportional graphical slider and a stop button), andb. the smaller progress indicator in the status bar (the one with a text percentage, an animating image, hover window, double-click to get progress view, no stop button) I'm trying to stay out of the vision business <g>.As far as I know, there are no plans to bring these together into a singlewidget. As you've noted, they have very different characteristcs.  a) is modal,cancelable, only shows one thing, and has a reasonable approximation ofprogress.  b) is non-modal, not directly cancelable, shows multiple jobs, andhas no estimate of progress. While it does seem weird to have two distinctprogress areas on the status line (especially when both of them start moving atonce, I don't know if there is a way to reconcile the two considering theirdifferent requirements. Someone on the UI team may be able to comment further. Please see http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/platform-ui-home/responsive-ui/M9proposal.html for the proposed solutions to the outstaning progress issues in M9. This dialog has been implemented and is avaialble by default.

This is API now.  wontfix  The type EnabledSubmission would be better named ContextSubmission. Clients browsing for context-related APIs generally look for types named *context*. Since the name has no relation to contexts, it's difficult to remember. And lastly, the name is almost oxymoronic. While the API may say ""add"" and ""remove"" EnabledSubmissions, clients logically think of this as enabling and disabling the submissions. Just saying ""then we disable our EnabledSubmission"" makes my head hurt. :)I think it's cleaner to call them ContextSubmissions, because that's what clients are really doing - submitting a context.

54709	[ContextMgmt] Enhance ContextManagerEvent	"I propose the following API for ContextManagerEvent. These are the methods I'd like the event to have (no more and no less).   getContextManager()   submissionAdded(String contextId)   submissionRemoved(String contextId)   contextEnabled(String contextId)   contextDisabled(String contextId)   contextDefined(String contextId)We in debugland want to know when submissions are added in order to promote views. It's important that we hear about submissions, not just enablement. A context will stay enabled for the life of a debug session, but we want to react when the user's selection switches between enabled contexts. Telling us when submissions are added is basically a way for us to know which context is the ""most active."" The story we want to implement in debug land is:Responding to context changes:1. When a debugging context is enabled, actions bound to that context appear (the workbench gives us this for free).2. When a debugging context is submitted, views bound to that context appear (our code).3. When a debugging context is disabled, actions bound to that context disappear (the workbench gives us this for free).4. When a debugging context is disabled, views bound to that context and no other active context are closed (our code).Activating contexts:1. When an element in the Debug view is selected (and the element provides the right adapter), we submit a context request.2. We keep a mapping of launches to the context requests they've submitted. A launch won't maintain more than one submission per context id. If it tries (say, by selecting multiple stack frames), a new request will be submitted and then the old one will be removed.3. When a launch terminates, all context submissions from that launch are removed. Since the IWorkbenchContextSupport API supports adding and removing multiple submissions at once, the methods I'm proposing should actually be plural. submissionsAdded(String[] contextIds), contextsEnabled(String[] contextIds), etc. I've got a first cut of this up and running in my workspace. Created attachment 8625org.eclipse.ui.workbench.20040316.patchHere's a patch with an initial implementation of the requested API.

Created attachment 8714org.eclipse.ui.workbench.20040319.patchChanges have been released to the project. This new patch is based on thecurrent HEAD stream contents. Created attachment 8757org.eclipse.ui.workbench.20040322.patchAfter talking with Doug on IRC, we decided to remove the idea of submissionnotifications. It represents a big change to the way contexts work that the UIteam doesn't want to make right now.Instead of using the submission notification, the Debug View now directlyinforms its context listener in cases where a submission event would have beenreceived. MVM has asked me to apply this patch for I200403300800.  The patch has been committed to CVS with two minor changes: 1.) The old methods on ContextManagerEvent are still supported (kind of) with deprecated warnings.  They will be removed before M9 ships. 2.) The ""toArray"" methods are passed arrays of the correct size (to avoid unnecessary object creation).  reopening this bug.1. the change returns String[]. did anyone notice that *all* of the othercontext, commands, or activity apis return collections instead of arrays?2. the change creates unnecessary asymmetry withing its own class:where is the getUndefinedContextIds() method?3. the change creates unnecessary asymmetry across other api's: where's theequivalent changes to CommandManagerEvent? ActivityManagerEvent?4. @deprecating the boolean methods is not correct. all of the other eventclasses across contexts, commands, and activities use this model to indicatechange. i don't want to have to check (enabled.isEmpty() && disabled.isEmpty())just to know if there was change to the overall set of enabled contexts. (orcommands.. or activities..)5. i can go fix this myself, but debug can expect to break due to my fix forpoint #1 above. i'd really rather these methods not have been added at all. imade a case on platform-ui-dev why i didn't think they were necessary andhaven't been given a valid use case in response. i've copied the originalrequest, and my reply below. sometimes there are good reasons why i would ask aclient (like debug) to do a couple of lines of calculations themselves.(see points #3 and #4 below)>The current ContextManagerEvents don't provide enough information for>our needs. In terms of the current API, I want to be able to register a>listener that's told every time someone adds an EnabledSubmission to the>workbench and everytime a context enables or disables. I also need to>know which contextId is involved.>>I think the ContextManagerEvent should have the following methods:>  getContextManager()>  submissionAdded(String contextId)>  submissionRemoved(String contextId)>  contextEnabled(String contextId)>  contextDisabled(String contextId)>  contextDefined(String contextId)>>An example execution flow:>1. ClientA submits contextA -  submissionAdded(contextA)>2. contextA becomes enabled - contextActivated(contextA)>3. ClientB submits contextA - submissionAdded(contextA)>4. ClientA removes contextA - submissionRemoved(contextA)>5. ClientB removes contextA - submissionRemoved(contextA)>6. contextB becomes disabled - contextDisabled(contextA)1. ContextManagerEvent does provide the method getContextManager().2. Regarding submissionAdded and submissionRemoved, why would you want to trackthis information? The submissions themselves aren't important, only the actualenabled contexts are. In fact, if someone submits a request to enabled a contextfor a particular part and that part isn't active at that time, theContextManager is not affected at all. Also, the ContextManager knows nothingabout the EnabledSubmission class, it only cares what contexts are actuallyenabled, so if you really needed this for some reason, the listener methods (anda new event object) would have to go someplace else, like on ICommandSupport.3. ContextManagerEvents are broadcast when the set of enabled contexts changesor the set of defined contexts changes (and tells you why it broadcast theevent). It doesn't tell you the specific deltas in the event, but you could keeptrack of that yourself with Set operations: i.e. Set newlyEnabledContexts = newHashSet(contextManager.getEnabledContextIds()).removeAll(previouslyEnabledContexts);If you would like the actual deltas included for you as well, please file anenhancement request and prefix [ContextMgmt] to the summary.4. ContextEvents are broadcast when a specific context is enabled/disabled ordefined/undefined, so you can watch individual contexts easily:i.e. IContextManager.getContext(""debugging.java"").addContextListener(..); The String[] to Collection change is no problem. If you release the changes to HEAD, I'll just fix up our code. I thought I'd already addressed your concerns either on the mailing list or the phone, but maybe I just *thought* of my answers and forgot to actually give them to you. :)#3 - ""Do it yourself""My argument here is that it's not a client's job to keep track of a manager's state. That's what the manager is for.#4 - ""Listen to contexts""The problem with this is that you hear about the activations in sequence. Our support allows clients to map multiple contexts to an element and the submission API allows for multiple submissions to be enabled at once. If multiple contexts are activated at the same time, I want to know about it.Hearing about them in sequence would introduce UI instability on my end. i understand your point about #4, though i disagree with point #3. asking formore information from an event is a common api sticky-point. that being said, ihave made the following changes:to ContextManagerEvent I have added two methods:Set getPreviouslyDefinedContextIds()Set getPreviouslyEnabledContextIds()to CommandsManagerEvent I have added three methods:Set getPreviouslyDefinedCategoryIds()Set getPreviouslyDefinedCommandIds()Set getPreviouslyDefinedKeyConfigurationIds()to ActivityManagerEvent *should* be added three methods:Set getPreviouslyDefinedCategoryIds()Set getPreviouslyDefinedContextIds()Set getPreviouslyEnabledContextIds()this introduces the idea that the events from managers should consistently passalong their previous states for the convenience of clients. (ICommandManageractually has a lot more properties that it could provide previous states for,but for now i started with the three properties that return Collections)the compromise is this: you no longer need to keep track of any state, but youdo need to do the set math yourself if you are interested in findingdifferences. i.e.Set getNewlyAddedEnabledContextIds(ContextManagerEvent contextManagerEvent) {    return newHashSet(contextManagerEvent.getContextManager().getEnabledContextIds()).removeAll(contextManagerEvent.getPreviouslyEnabledContextIds());}Set getNewlyRemovedEnabledContextIds(ContextManagerEvent contextManagerEvent) {    return newHashSet(contextManagerEvent.getPreviouslyEnabledContextIds()).removeAll(contextManagerEvent.getContextManager().getEnabledContextIds());}i don't want to add these convenience methods to the event classes right nowbecause of method bloat. i plan on checking these changes into head within the next half hour. ps. those changes were put into head already. i'm only leaving this open toremind me to do the activity event changes.. Doug, could you look into the Activity event changes? ActivityManagerEvent changes are in CVS.  Verified that the API exists in I200405190010, but not whether it works.

We tried hard to come up with context menus that are not too large. The rules we used are:- action with prominent short cuts are not part of the context menu- action executed not so often aren't in the context menu either.Since rebuild project isn't a frequent action it is only available via the global Project menu. This surprises me since I use ""Rebuild project"" very often. So do my collegues who encouraged me to send this report.Plus there is no shortcut set for it by default. Why do you need Rebuild project so often. Eclipse incremental builder shouldn't require losts of full rebuilds. It often happened when we had to import and re-compile old projects developed on other IDEs, for example.In any way, I think that the context menu of a project should contain all direct project operations.In Java, you expect a class Project to have an object method rebuild() so that you can write ""project.rebuild();"" instead of having a static method rebuild(Project p) and writing ""rebuild(project);"". This might be a metaphore for the difference between context menus and application menus. That's the reason why build is in the context menu.

54671	[Commands] [Services] HandlerSubmission with IPageSite doesn't work	"Build ID: I20040310. GEF's palette page, which due to the lack of a KeyBindingService, creates and registers its own HandlerSubmissions to enable actions. When a HandlerSubmission is created with a null argument for the IWorkbenchSite (first parameter in the constructor), the actions work on the page. When getSite() is specified instead, which returns the IPageSite for the page, the actions do not work on the page. The site must be one of the sites reachable by workbenchWindow.getActivePage().getActivePart().getSite().  I'm sorry that isn't documented.  In that case, wouldn't it make more sense to use IWorkbenchPartSite instead of IWorkbenchSite? One would assume that, wouldn't they?  :)  This is a bug with HandlerSubmission, and hence a problem with Commands.  I'm going to reassign this to Chris, so he can think about what to do.

Add a new file, call it main.cpp.3. Insert the following code into main.cpp:	class C {	  public:	    int i;	    int j;	    int k;	};	class B {	  public:	    bool b;	    bool b2;	};		class A : public B, protected C {	  public:	    float f;	    float f2;	};		void foo(A* a)	{	    dynamic_cast<B*>(a)->b=false; // Ok	    dynamic_cast<C*>(a)->[^SPC];  // Should not work as C is protected	}Result: A completion list is presented to the user containing ""i"", ""j"", and ""k"".Expected: ""No completions available"" error message as 'C' is an inaccessiblebase of 'A'.* Also tested on Windows XP Dynamic cast has different rules for visibility than normal casts.  CompleteParseASTFactory needs to be updated.   foo() could be called with another subclass of A which does publicly (or virtually) inherit from C.  we do not know if the runtime cast is going to succeed or fail for all uses unless we look at all of the references to foo() and see what parameters are being passed in.  if 'a' was (instead of a parameter) an object that we knew the absolute type for, then we could make that call.  However, in my opinion, the behaviour we give at this point is correct, as if I was attempting to dereference a dynamic_cast<>, I would have to be pretty sure the cast would succeed.  Regardless, I'll let Dave rule on whether or not its a requirement to take this further.  The symbol table currently doesn't differentiate between 'absolute' and 'expected' types, so we would have to have some heuristic along the lines of ""if the parameter is pointing at a variable and not a parameter"".   This is a minor problem.   It is not worth any effort to fix.  (I would place this as a P4...) Actually, the expression 'dynamic_cast<C*>(a)' is a compile error:../tmp.cpp: In function `void foo(A*)':../tmp.cpp:23: error: `C' is an inaccessible base of `A'All bets are off if you are trying to complete code that has a compile error.

I´m using hierarchical layout. When I expand a package with a changed file and click on it and the click again on the package, the label decorations appears. This happens for files changed between the last start of Eclipse and the crash. This is most likely due to resources being out-of-sync with the file system. Perform a refresh on the projects in question and the decorators should reappear.

54534	background colors in labels for warning/errors/csv status	"This has been released to HEAD - it is now possible to decorate colours and text in an IDecoration.Please note that this API is expermental and may be adjusted during the viewer work in 3.1. Also if the APIs are been released I still can't see any of the existingdecorator make use of this new feature (which actually was the subject for thisrfe).I expected to see an option to choose background/foreground color for dirty/newfiles for team providers in preferences->team->CVS->label decorationand an option somewhere to choose background/foreground color for files withwarnings or errors in the package explorer (something like the screenshotsprovided).Do I have to open addictional bug report for those? To which component should Iassign them: team, cvs, jdt ui? I'll move this to Team as they will provide the CVS support (sorry - should hav renamed this). You can know configure the font/color for ignored and outgoing resources. Movingto JDT to consider something similar for markers in the packages view. Tod, how is arbitration done when multiple label decorators want to setcolors/font? Is it just random which one is used? I think there should be somesort of defined prioritization or ""merging"" of colors, such that we can ensurethat e.g. error color is always more important than team color.Note that the old decoration types allows multiple decorations for the sameelement: text can only be added, but not replaced; images should only be smalloverlays and let the rest of the icon alone. We don't intend to change the suffix/prefix addition algorithm - replacing the text was not something people wanted to happen whenthey had no control over it due to a contributed decorator from another plug-in.If there is conflict between the decorator and the font or color provider of the viewer the decorator takes precedent. If two decorators are trying to do the same thing or decorate the same quadrant we do not currently do any conflict resolution. See Bug 36007 BTW you could add a color or font provider to the packages view and then allow the CVS decorator to override it when they are on as the decorator takes precedence. Closing are there is nothing else to do on our part. Verified that our support is in M3 (thanks for moving it back - I missed it in my test pass). Actually label decorations for warning/errors/cvs conflicts are only represented by a small icon or a "">"" sign. Sometimes it's really difficult to see such small labels, expecially if you have more decorations.Allowing users to select a backgroung/foreground color for labels will really improve user experience.A similar feature is currently implemented in instantiations codepro, but only using custom views (they call them package explorer+, resources+). It sound strange to reimplement views only to add a (also if useful) background color... it would be really great to have a support for this feature available in the base UI framework, so that could be used in any view.This is a screeshot from codepro colored view:http://www.instantiations.com/codepro/ws/docs/images/package_explorer_plus_view.gifAnd the preference page where users can choose colors:http://www.instantiations.com/codepro/ws/docs/images/preferences_browsers.gifThis would be a nice addiction in the new [workbench]->[colors and fonts] preference page just added with the new look'n feel. I'm all for nice addictions <g>. Actually, once the ILightweight decorator implements IColorProvider and IFontProvider we could possibly allow customization of these for the CVS decorator. Until then, since our decorator is an ILightWeightDecorator, we can't do anything about it. We won't be doing this in the 3.0 timeframe. Marking later Reopening now that 3.0 has shipped Related to Bug 61869 This is actually not that hard.We would need to change IDecoration to also allow colours but as no one is meant to implement that this would not be a breaking change.Likewise IDecoratorManager could add a getColorProvider method and a getFontProvider method which would not break anyone.Jean-Michel is this something you would do in the 3.1 timeframe?

54476	[KeyBindings] User needs access to multiple configurations	"The workbench should support multiple, orthogonal keybinding configurations. For example, for a WYSIWYG HTML editor (or any other non-source editor), ""emacs"" configuration makes no sense.  They would instead want to define configurations for other HTML keybindings, such as ""FrontPage"", ""DreamWeaver"", etc.  The user should be able to activate simultaneously the ""emacs"" mode for the Java editor, and the ""frontpage"" mode for the html editor. This is interesting, but complicated.  It is also a fair departure from tools such as Microsoft Visual Studio.  Arguably, contexts provide a similar mechanism, but without the same ease in configuration (i.e., you would have to define key configurations -- e.g., ""Emacs Text / DreamWeaver HTML"" or ""Eclipse Text / Emacs HTML"").  It might be possible to make the argument that Emacs key bindings do make sense for an HTML editor.  I'm not a fan of them myself, but Emacs does have HTML plug-ins which do define additional key bindings (google: html-helper-mode).   Doug, ""E-macs"" keybindings don't make sense for a WYSIWYG HTML editor.  Maybe ""Frontpage"" or ""Dreamweaver"" might make sense instead, which is why I opened this bug.  If I had been talking about an HTML *source* editor, then I would agree that e-macs could be activated for the source view, while frontpage might be activated for the ""design"" view (wysiwyg).I know that a possible implementation might use contexts, but it doesn't change the problem with the UI presentation in the keybindings preference page. I currently use Emacs mode in Eclipse for both code and HTML.  I cannot fathomwhy the poster asserts that emacs keybindings make no sense for documents otherthan code.

54450	requestInUI seems to have a race condition (fails most times)	"I'm trying to exercise the job API that lets me query the user via a UI job and the requestInUI call.  I get no Status back from the call unless I step through the logic in the debugger.  Only then do I get a non-null return from the method.This is my logic:   private boolean askUserForHelp() {      UIJob uiJob = new UIJob(""Help Request"") {         public IStatus runInUIThread(IProgressMonitor monitor) {            if (MessageDialog.openQuestion(PlatformUI.getWorkbench()                  .getActiveWorkbenchWindow().getShell(), ""Choose"",                  ""Should we run the runnable?""))               return Status.OK_STATUS;            else               return Status.CANCEL_STATUS;         }      };      IProgressService ps = PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getProgressService();             IStatus choice = ps.requestInUI(uiJob, ""Help Me"" + getName());      if (choice.getCode() == 0)         return true;      else         return false;   }The job I have processes some work and then does more (a runnable passed to the job for fun).  I'm trying to make that 2nd bit of work optional based on the user prompt.  This works only if I step through the logic, deep down into feedbackManager.requestInUI(job, message) where it sets up another UIJob and then uses a join() to wait on the response.Not sure if it is because of the async job execution (Something I had not noticed before on my API tour), or what.  Another observation is that it seemed like the inUI request was not removed from the prompt dialog.The general purpose Errors Running Jobs dialog gets opened, but it is not helping identify what exception is thrown (I'm wondering if this dialog actually shows enough information, even when you open details it is redundantly showing the same thing twice - and little specific info that I can find a way to influence so far). I have to go to the error log to see that it is a NullPointerException; this is due to the fact my choice var above is null after the requestInUI call.An aside; I got the impression from EclipseCON that this user request would be a hint to see what was needed vs a dialog that opened on top of their current work.  Is this prompt technique still under development or finalized?I've been running my code on both M7 and I20040310. Any UI job is executed asynronously in the UI Thread - this is a requirement of it.The purpose of this API is to stop the current process pending the result of a UI Job that you are requesting execution on. The requestInUI brings up the dialog to deal with the request and when the user runs the job you continue.I am not sure what the problem is here. Could you be more specific as to what you think is wrong? When I use the api and just let it run an exception is thown.  If I run in debug with breakpoints I can step through the lower layer logic that uses the passed UIJob to ask the question and I actually get the result back in the API call.  When it runs free the result is null.  (this is from memory - I'll try and work up my exact error again later). As I understand the API I can do the following:// JDG2E: 2D2 Get progress service and run the UIJobIProgressService ps = PlatformUI.getWorkbench() .getProgressService();IStatus choice = ps.requestInUI(uiJob,  ""Job needs help deciding what to do next."" + "" Job: "" + getName());The above has a uijob that opens a yes/no dialog.  The response create an IStatus returned at the completion of the uijob, which I expect to get in the choice IStatus above.  The result of running the code above returns a null IStatus value in choice.If I follow the requestInUI code a bit I find that the problem is down in ProgressFeedbackManager.requestInUI():-------openProgressJob.schedule();  try{    job.join();  }  catch (InterruptedException exception){    return ProgressManagerUtil.exceptionStatus(exception);  }		return statuses[0];-------The schedule above is a uijob to open the dialog that will list the uijob I provided on my call to IProgressService.requestInUI().The join is on my passed uijob.  But as my uijob does not get scheduled until it is selected in the ""Jobs Awaiting Progress"" dialog, the join does not wait; instead it returns and a null status is returned.  The null status triggers an exception later (as I did not check for null).I guess I could join on my own uijob, but that was not required per my reading of the IProgressService.requestInUI spec. This was due to a faulty blocking algorithm which effectively never blocked.I beleive this fixes your cases but as they are quite thorough I would like to go through them all before I close this.Thanks for your help Pat - that simple example at the end really helped me get to the root of the problem right away. Adding John for some advice. I'm tempted to suggest pulling this API for 3.0.  We are not using it in theSDK. Jean-Michel tried it and found some improvements that would be needed tomake it truly useful (bug 50044). To fix this particular bug, we would need tospec more clearly how long the caller is blocked (if at all). If the user closesthe request dialog, what happens (think of how many people ignore the WindowsUpdate prompts)?  It currently doesn't work because the call to job.join() will not block if thejob has not yet been scheduled. It would instead have to wait on a flag that isset in the JobChangeListener's done() method. I think this API is a great idea, but needs a bit more work (and some referenceimplementations) to make it real. Sounds like something for 3.1 at this point. That is probably fine, users of this API would be advanced users of the Job capability, and that will be a learning/growth curve for all.I'm not sure who else you should ask first - just in case some have thought about possible scenarios where this api would be useful.  I know from soft questions that some of the teams down my way are starting to 'wake up' to the possibilities provided by the Jobs API. This API has been  deferred to 3.1 Reopening now that 3.0 has shipped Closing this as adding anything else is not currently planned.

54440	[Coolbar] Binary Compat: IToolBarManager.update method doesn't work	"We use code like following:private void createPageToolbar() {	IToolBarManager manager = workbook.getActionBars().getToolBarManager();	manager.removeAll();	IAction dowloadArtifactAction = new Action() {				public void run() {			downloadArtifact();		}	};	manager.add(dowloadArtifactAction);	manager.update(true);}it works ok for Eclipse 2.x but doesn't for 3.0 (toolbar doesn't reflect changes like add/remove actions). We have discovered that IActionBars.updateActionBars() resolves this problem and we wondered if it is our bug or Eclipse's bug and is there any workaround. I'll investigate for M9.  I would expect that update(true) would force an update of the tool bar layout.  I'm not sure how it interacts with cool bar.  Can you provide a small snippet I can run on my machine that shows the problem?  Ines: could you look at this one as well?  I want a reproducible test case....  Created attachment 10266Simple view plug-inThis is a simple view plug in I modified. I believe this an example of what youare mentioning in this bug report, if I understand the code snippet correctly. The project adds 2 items onto the view's tool bar (Action 1 and Action2).Steps:- Select the ""Add action 3"" item.- A 3 rd item is added to the toolbar.- Select the ""Remove action 3"" item.- The 3 rd item is removed from the toolbar.I tested this plug-in in M8 and it does addition/removal of items in the toolbar correctly. The only caveat is that you have to set your own id for theaction if you want to be able to remove it. But the “update(true)” seems towork fine. The toolbar is not updated unless I have that call in the code. Here is a simple plug in I wrote to illustrate this bug. Re-assigning to Doug. Please investigate Ines.  See if you can come up with a patch to fix it. From what I tested, I did not find any problems with ""update(true)"". The simpleplug-in I attached to this report adds and removes actions on a view's toolbarusing the same method calls as described in this bug. I am waiting for thereporter of the bug to post their sample project to see why their algorithm isnot functioning properly. Marking this bug as works for me since I could not reproduce this problem.Please re-open and attach your sample code if this bug persists. Created attachment 10329Code ExampleThe example is composed from one view. Use view pulldown menu, select 'Addbutton on toolbar' action. As you can see from the source, the action just addsa new action on toolbar. If our code is wrong, could you provide us withcorrect one. What eclipse build are you using? I ran this on 2.1, M8 and Build id:200405060200 with the same result for all.Here are my steps:- I imported your project in my workspace, left the ""update(true)"" method callin the code and commented out the ""updateActionBars"" call (it was already commented)- I ran as run-time workbench- I selected ""Add button on toolbar""- The little ""i"" button showed up on the tool bar (see screen shot)- When I selected the ""i"", a dialog showed up with the ""Action 2 executed"" messageAre you expecting something else to happen that I am not seeing? Thanks for yourfeedback. Created attachment 10343The toolbar iconScreenshot of the icon that appears when I select the menu item with the""update(true)"" call in the code. The ""updateActionBars()"" method call iscommented out. Ines, we use 3.0 M7. We know that the code, we've sent you, works pretty good on 2.1. And that is why we are suprised that it doesn't work on 3.0 M7. Probably, it is M7 specific bug... Yeah, you are correct, it does not work in M7. I am not sure what happenedthere, but it seems to have been fixed in subsequent releases. And if you arestuck using M7, then your work around seems to solve this problem. no, the problem is not solved in M9. When adding an item to the Toolbar, changes are not reflected after calling manager.update(true);       logger.debug(""creating Toolbar"");      IToolBarManager mgr = this.formEditor.getEditorSite().getActionBars().getToolBarManager();      // mgr.removeAll();      mgr.add(myAction);      mgr.update(true);The item appears after Editor is deactivated. The problem you are reporting might be slightly different. I ran the sampleplug-ins attached to this bug report on M9 and Build id: 200405280010 with noproblems. I am aware that the latter plug-ins did not behave correctly in M7.Could you attach a sample plug-in reflecting your problem? I am not able toreproduce this issue otherwise. Ines are you saying the case in comment #15 is not recreatable? on which build? I just tried the two sample plug-ins attached with 3.0RC1 and they behavecorrectly. My guess is that the problem reported in comment  #15 is differentthan this bug. He is using an editor, so this might have to do with editoractivation/de-activation. I know there have been some changes applied lately inthat area.I also created a sample editor (that extends FormEditor, to try to reproduceexactly) and just tried the code below with no problems. So no, I can notreproduce the case in comment #15, but I can look at it if he attached a sampleexample. Here is what I tried:"" final IToolBarManager mgr =  this.getEditorSite().getActionBars().getToolBarManager();  final Action action2 = new Action() {  public void run() {    showMessage(""Action 2 executed"");   }  };  Action action1 = new Action() {   public void run() {    mgr.add(action2);    mgr.update(true);   }  };  action2.setText(""Action 2"");  action2.setToolTipText(""Action 2 tooltip"");  action2.setImageDescriptor(PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getSharedImages()			.getImageDescriptor(ISharedImages.IMG_OBJS_INFO_TSK));  action1.setText(""Add button on toolbar"");  action1.setToolTipText(""Add button on toolbar"");  action1.setImageDescriptor(PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getSharedImages()		 .getImageDescriptor(ISharedImages.IMG_OBJS_INFO_TSK));  mgr.add(action1);  mgr.update(true);"" Closing since I do not have a reproducible case.

In this case I added the ""EJS*"" filter. It works, but is not officially supported. You can use this at you own discretion. However any core workbench problems reported with any such change present are not be supported. At the current time, the only sanctioned way to add a filter to the Navigator view, is  to create separate plugin and contribute the filters instead of modifying an existing product plugin. The UI is a separate plug-in in core Eclipse which happens to own this base Navigator view. WebSphere Studio Workbench or Eclipse development does not support any modification to the base. The UI plug-in is part of that base. Example:In WSAD v5.x there is a large set of filters in the base Navigator view. The various plug-ins added these through a plug-in api()...etc. The good news is that apart from thissanctioned mechanism to add filters to the base Navigator view, adding a filter to the plugi-in.xml file of the UI file will ony affect the Navigator view. This change does not carry over to say the Explorer Package view of the Java perspective or the Project Navigator of the J2EE Perspective. Similarly any change to filters in a custom Navigator, such as adding a filter in the J2EE Project Navigator, will not show up in the base Navigator view. There is  a clean and logical separation of concerns in the design.Clearly, writing a plug-in is not an option for many users or an activity they may wish to invest time in to just a filter(s). Our customers raised the need to be able to add filters to the base Navigator for general use across all perspectives. This basic add filter capabilityis present in base Navigators of other IDE technologies.I have create this eclipse bugzilla defect/feature request to provide a add/remove user filters capabilty in the UI Navigator GUI (e.g. an add filter button at minimum,and maybe a remove button restricted to filters not associated with a plug-in).

Created attachment 8475the class used for testing targetting future instead of M10 since this bug doesn't always happen.  This problem is particularly prevalent on AIX.  Rob, this should have been fixed.  Can you verify and close as appropriate?  Thanks. The problem still exists on AIX. The problem seems to be related to the ad-hoc way that the piAgent determinesthe _ticksPerMicrosecond value, which is then used for converting the ""timestampin ticks"" to a wall-clock time. The AIX Technical Reference(http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/UserInfo/Resources/Hardware/IBMp690/IBM/usr/share/man/info/en_US/a_doc_lib/libs/basetrf2/read_real_time.htm)indicates that the way the value obtained from read_real_time() should beconverted is by using time_base_to_time(). It's not possible to do this the way the code is currently structured, but I didsome hacking (not for check in -- just to run some tests) and found that if weuse the time_base_to_time() method for converting the high-precision time into awall-clock time, the problem reported in this bug goes away. As a proper fix, we should consider scrapping the code that determines_ticksPerMicrosecond (on the platforms where possible) and using other API'sprovided by the platform which probably yield more accurate results.  Ran some more tests, and I'm convinced that the problem is that we'reunderestimating the _ticksPerMicrosecond value. Suppose we calculate the _ticksPerMicrosecond to be 5, but the actual value is 10. If we observe 10 ticks having elapsed, then we will calculate that as 2microseconds real-time having elapsed, but in reality it will only have been 1microsecond. If we observe 40 ticks having elapsed, then we will calculate thatas 8 microseconds real-time having elapsed, but in reality it will only havebeen 4 microseconds. The longer the program runs, the larger the differencebetween the time we measure, and the actual time that has elapsed. However, theratio between the time we calculate and the time in reality will be constant(e.g. we calculate 2 microseconds, but only 1 microsecond has elapsed: 2:1ratio; we calculate 8 microseconds, but reality 4 microseconds has elapsed:again 2:1 ratio). I generated to following table as evidence of this from a number of tests (thiswas using the InOut test case as specified in the original description of thisdefect):Cumulative time as         Cumulative time as                A/Breported by Hyades         reported by console (A)                         (B)20.129009	           19.293		             1.043332245.719063                  43.86                             1.0423863171.577636                 164.683                           1.0418661220.597418                 211.745		             1.0418069Notice that the longer the program executes, the larger the discrepancy betweenthe time we calculate as having elapsed and the actual time that has elapsed.Moreover, the ratio between these two values (the third column) is roughlyconstant.

54377	CCombo edited value is not preserved (when mouse selects another cell within table)	The problem is present and reproducible. Following are details:We have a table with several rows. CellEditors are CCombo type (editable). When user starts changing the value of the cell and decide to move to another cell (by mouse click) the latest/edited value of the previous cell is not set. The same problem is not present if these cells are Combo type. This look like CCombo bug.... Boskothx, Bosko CellEditors is JFace.  Can you see any reason this would be happening in the CellEditor code?

54380	[EditorMgmt] Loss of editor pick drop-down	I200403100800I love the new editor drop-down, even more when it gets a key binding. But sometimes I can't access it anymore. Clicking on the editor tab doesn't make it appear anymore.The last time this occured was when I split the editor area to have two editors side by side, then when I stacked the editors back the drop-down didn't appear anymore. This will have a key binding - see bug 54342.  Will leave this bug open to address the issue of the drop down not appearing. - in the latest builds you need to click the '>>' button. - the list only should show the non-visible but open editors.

54284	[Scalability] Search fails to give all declarations of a medium large project	Build 040304  RAM 512 (could only use 330)In Search, part of the scalability requirement, as a P1, is to search for all declarations named * of any type.   The workspace would have a large number of tokens in the scope.I took a project that had a total 738 .c, .cpp, .hpp and .h files. Please see me for the project.Steps:1) Load the project in Eclipse/CDT2) Bring up the Search C/C++ Dialog3) Credentials:Search For: Any elementLimit To: DeclarationsScope: Workspace4) Click on SearchIt could never finish it.  It seemed that after 30 minutes, Eclipse did not have enough memory to perform the operation.  It started at a reasonable pace believing it will finish in 7 minutes or so. But the search slowed down exponentially. It was at about 85% that CDT looked stuck. By cancelling the Search, Eclipse/CDT took 10 to do it.I am just reporting the fact that CDT can not handle such a search even though an experience developer will not do this as he will do a more specific search.  Should we discourage the use of * with a message or other UI indicators? We need to analyze what's happening here w/memoryI'll accept the defect for the time being Raised to P2 since it failed a test case (thus affecting pass rate) Mathieu, Can send me an email pointing me towards the project (unless its one you think I already have). This project does not build as it is, and is not setup whatsoever.  There are no include paths discovered (due to the build failures) and the compiler being used is Microsoft Visual C++.  That being said ... I didn't even try running this w/256 MB of RAM, I skipped right to the advanced steps. Running w/512M RAM: Indexing completes fine and then Search craps out @ 7119 matches (but only done 13%).  This took about 12 minutes.  Running w/1024M RAM: Indexing completes fine and then Search continues on for 45 minutes and completes w/a total of 28,625 matches.  While I agree that we can do better, markers are not free and at some point, irregardless of how much memory Search and the parser take up, a wildcard search will run out of memory on a large enough project.  We need to add a user preference which by limits wildcard search results from the dialog (to 1000, say), as this is generally a recipe for disaster, particularly when we search on Any Element.  I would even be alright with disallowing Search for *.  Even displaying this many search results in the Search View causes significant refresh problems. This cannot be fixed for 2.0, moving the defect off to 2.0.1 we shall address it there with our scalability review.   The really sad thing is that Searching takes almost 8 times as much time as Indexing.  I am positive that it would be faster to ignore the indexer results and parse the transitive closure calculation for these wildcard search cases.  Update in 2.0.1 : Indexing does not complete @ 256 MB of RAM. 512 MB RAM : Indexing completes in a couple of minutes.  Search takes 8 minutes to complete, reporting > 30,000 matches.   With Bogdan's latest fixes on the HEAD, Search takes 6 minutes.  Moving defect off to 2.1 for Indexer < 256MB work item.  W/Search using offsets, this is as best as we can do.  Search uses constant time and linear memory to the number of matches.  	2012-12-12 15:51:40	1355350000.0	resolved fixed	113c0bd	1357590000.0	java/org/apache/catalina/core/ApplicationContext.java java/org/apache/catalina/deploy/FilterDef.java java/org/apache/catalina/deploy/ServletDef.java test/org/apache/catalina/core/TestApplicationContext.java test/org/apache/catalina/deploy/TestFilterDef.java test/org/apache/catalina/deploy/TestServletDef.java

54207	j9 launcher plugin uses deprecated -bp: flag	"The -bp: flag for specifying bootclasspath entries has been deprecated for quite a long time.  The preferred flag is -Xbootclasspath.  The j9 launcher plugin uses -bp, and this causes warning messages to appear each time an app is launched. Created attachment 8445Patch to fix bugThis patch switches the j9 launcher from using the -bp: flag to using-Xbootclasspath:. Isn't this just a duplicate of bug 19406? Oh, I guess I forgot that I'd mentioned this earlier, sorry.  However, this patch I provided is probably better than the one in bug 19406 since I understand the plugin better now.  I would mark the other one as a dupe of this one, and use the patch here instead. BTW, I understand Photon is no longer supported.  Do we still support AIX for the Eclipse SDK?  If so, does it use J9 still? *** Bug 19406 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** David, looking at this patch, the fix uses the ""append to bootpath"" option. The launching infrastrucure now supports prepend, append, and ""replace"" bootpath options. Does J9 support ""-Xbootclasspath/p:"", ""-Xbootclasspath/a:"" and ""-Xbootclasspath:""? If so, we should add support as is done in StandardVMRunner.addBootClassPathArguments(...). Probably ""prepend"" is the correct approach.  I will look at the method you mentioned. The launcher needs to honor whatever the user specifies in the tab - i.e. the container that identifies the JRE (JRE_CONTAINER) represents the default bootpath. If they put something before the default bootpath, we prepend. If they add something after, we append (they can also do both at once). If they remove the default container, we specify an explicit bootpath. Created attachment 8541Improved patch to fix bugI fixed the bootclasspath to respect the various append and prepend options. Also fixed the debugging support, since J9 for the last 2 releases is usingstandard JDK debug options, instead of proprietary j9proxy.exe. Applied patch with small modification - the bootpath support has changed slightly to be less ""breaking"" for existing launch delegates. Changes to #addBootClassPathArguments(..) in JavaVMRunner. Marking as verified (David can let us know if it does not work).

It really depends what you are doing. If you are comparing to merge a lot of changes or compare often against the same branch/tag then you can simply remember the comparison and have it update automatically by having it added to the sync view. This can be useful, but as you mentioned, not all the time.The naming really depends on what you consider ""Synchronizing"" to mean. If you are comparing or merging to change local resources, IMHO, you can consider this a synchronization task.Next weeks I-build will fix this by providing a dialog by default, then optionally allowing you to remember it in the sync view.

53854	implement State#compare	Some questions, Jeff:- what is the comparison criteria? Bundle ids (longs)? Location? Symbolic namesand versions?- what level of comparison are you thinking of? Bundle presence/absence? Orshould we go deep and compare constraints and bundle description attributes?- regardless the answers for the questions above are, it seems to me that wedon't need any priveldged knowledge on the state implementation internals. So, Iwould suggest we could provide such method on the new StateHelper API instead. Agreed that we should not need internal knowledge.Not sure about the criteria.  Starting point is symbolic name and version.  The main usecase I am thinking of here is for commit().  There you need to know what things to installBundle() and uninstall().  YOu don't have control over the long id or the constraints.  Assuming the resolvers are the same you should end up with the same constraint setup after the commit.As for level of detail, perhaps as deep as can be represented in a delta?  Not really sure what that means.We have a new StateHelper API? About the new StateHelper API: I moved the non-essential methods inBundleDescription/State (and some internal convenience methods) such asgetUnsatisfiedConstraints and others to the StateHelper interface. Initially, Ithought of it as a class with static methods in theorg.eclipse.osgi.service.resolver package. But then we decided to provide itfrom PlatformAdmin#getStateHelper. I am still not happy with that - in 1stplace, because it should be a class with only static methods. 2nd, because itshould be made less prominent, maybe in a util package.About matching bundles in two states: in the commit scenario, the bundle idsseem to be the best choice, since one state was created from the other, so thebundle ids (for the common bundles) match. Using symbolic names is hard becausethey are not mandatory. What about locations? Are they mandatory/unique?BTW, since the PlatformAdmin and State implementations are tied together, weknow the internals of both states. Thus, we don't need compare as API for thecommit case. I know that there are others, but cannot remember... what are theother use cases? the other case is for things like update and PDE where they are allowing the user to explicitly configure the state.  They want to be able to iterate add/remove, resolve and may need to compare to show the user what they are about to do. So I change my mind... PDE/Update will be using the factory provided by thestate if they are willing to commit the changes later. In that case, theplatform admin knows the implementation for the state object provided. That(knowing the internal implementation) makes comparison using bundle ids simpleto implement. If a bundle has to be changed, State#update should be used, thuspreserving the bundle id.Any concerns if I follow this path? sounds good. Released to HEAD. Retrofitted PlatformAdmin#commit to use State#compare. Need towrite tests.  State#compare had its semantics changed to so the state taken as argument is thebase, and the target state is the one containing changes.Comparison can be done between arbitrary implementations, and is as simple as this:- changed state has a bundle (location is the key) that the base does notcontain: bundle has been ADDED - changed state does not have a bundle that the base does contain: bundle hasbeen REMOVED- both states have a bundle (again, location is the key) - the bundle will beseen as UPDATED only if State#updateBundle was called on the changed bundle.Otherwise they be deemed equal and not change will be reported (no smartin-depth comparisons here).Test cases added to org.eclipse.osgi.tests (StateComparisonTest). Implement State#compare. Spec is:/** * Returns a delta describing the differences between this state and the * given state. This state is taken as the base so the absence of a bundle * in the given state is reported as a deletion, etc. *  * @param state * @return */public StateChangeEvent compare(State state);BTW, it should return a StateDelta instead. 	2012-09-11 20:28:09	1347410000.0	resolved fixed	a3e0f09	1349030000.0	java/org/apache/naming/resources/BaseDirContext.java java/org/apache/naming/resources/FileDirContext.java java/org/apache/naming/resources/WARDirContext.java

42181	jardesc does not allow workspace-relative paths [jar creation]	All path specifications in a jardesc require absolute paths.  This causes problems such as this scenario:when we use cvs team integration, and we have different branches of the code line, we cannot use the same sandbox workspace folder name.  So for the trunk it might be called 'myworkspace_trunk' but on the new version branch it might be called 'myworkspace_v2-1_branch'.  Therefore a revision managed jardesc would have to be edited on each branch code line to use the folder name of the branch as part of the absolute path.A Workspace-relative path could remove the need to specify the absolute path to the output jar, and internally resolve the absolute path of the workspace such that if I say staging/myproject.jar, the logic would be relative to the  specific workspace directory.It might be a nice addition to support Eclipse variables as well in the path, like ${WAS_HOME}/lib/myproject.jar *** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 41178 *** 	2007-04-21 22:48:21	1177210000.0	resolved fixed	cd05aa1	1346110000.0	java/org/apache/coyote/http11/filters/ChunkedInputFilter.java java/org/apache/tomcat/util/buf/HexUtils.java test/org/apache/tomcat/util/buf/TestHexUtils.java

This is by designed. The local variable 'type' is initialized. This is considered a write access. If you put a field modification watchpoint on a field that is initialized, the debugger would stop at this breakpoint.OK to close? Indeed, initializations are write accesses. Gnaaaaa ...It looks like I was not clear in the explanation of the problem.I totaly agree that the local variable declarations are write access and have tobe displayed in the search results.My problem is in the how it's displayed, we currently get two element in theresult tree (when using the New Search view) : the method and the local variabledeclaration :  + manageBreakpoint(IEditorInput) : void (1 match)    + IType typeorg.eclipse.jdt.internal.debug.ui.actions.ManageBreakpointActionDelegate#manageBreakpoint(IEditorInput)(1 match)I think that having one element for the method that contains the two matchesshould be enought :  + manageBreakpoint(IEditorInput) : void (2 matches)I don't think that having an extra leaf for the local type declaration gives anyinformation. Local variables are elements now, but it is a UI decision to render them in search result view or not. Maybe this could be an option, unclear ?Moving to UI. Well, I disagree, if we're currently showing the innermost element that we canassing a match to. If we're deciding to depart from that policy, we should allowgrouping on any level, basically.

53697	[java debug] Automatic disconnect after N timeout exceptions	"<Pyinson Data Over Head> This is e3m7 Looks like the communication with the VM got disconnected without feedback in the UI. The model thought it was still connected and attempted to send all your commands - resulting in timeouts. Do you have steps to reproduce? Does it happen often? I have only had it happend once but then I haven't been using m7 all that longand I can probably count the number of times I have been in the debugger on myfingers.I don't have repro steps but I was hoping there was something you could fixbased on the stack trace.  If it happens again I'll see if I can repro. Marking as works for me. Workaround is to increase debugger timeout value if required, on the ""Java > Debug"" preference page. I think in general that solution is ok but I think that there should be acounter in the connection code that if a timeout occurs say 500 times within a 2minute period of time then you should disconnect from the vm and give a warningwith an explanation on how to increase this timeout value.  I don't think it is accectable to just throw timeout exceptions and have eclipselock until the remote vm is shutdown. Bug 45980 addresses any blocking (i.e. will do hotswap in background job). Deferring this bug as a feature request to auto-disconnect when many timeouts occurr. Hello, is the feature already implemented in Eclipse 3.2 or planned for a future release? We encoutered a similar problem, that when a timeout connection occurs in an Eclipse 3.1 IDE, the debugger hangs and disconnecting the remote vm is not possible anymore. So, an automatic disconnect when the timeout occurs would be practicable, so we wouldn't need to restart the IDE. Thanks and best regards, Marion Nothing planned - closing. Much effort has been put into the debug views to interact/update asynchronously with the debug target to avoid blocking the UI.

53700	[MPE] [EditorMgmt] MultiPageEditorPart should be supported better by editor manager	"Eclipse Forms add support for multi-page editors where some pages are forms, but one or more pages are source editors.Here is the scenario that will represent a significant problem for PDE:Imagine a multi-page editor based on MultiPageEditorPart that has more than one source editor as tabs. Each source editor opens a different file in the project. Example: new PDE manifest editor will open plugin.xml, META-INF/MANIFEST.MF and build.properties in their corresponding tabs all the time.The same editor is registered for all three files - the only difference is thatdifferent pages are initially selected for each file.Imagine that you opened plugin.xml. Since there are source editors in MultiPageEditorPart, some have editor input for files opened by the editor itself (not by the user).Now imagine that while the editor is still open, you select 'build.properties' and open it as well.Today: a new instance of the multi-page editor is openedDesired behaviour: editor manager should detect that an instance of MultiPageEditorPart is opened and that one of its nested editors has the matching input. The editor should simply be brought to front (ideally, a suitable page should also be shown but we can think about it later).The UI team has all that is needed to achieve this behaviour - MultiPageEditorPart belongs to the UI team and it can do something like this:if (editorPart instanceof MultiPageEditorPart) {   MultiPageEditorPart multiEditor = (MultiPageEditorPart)editorPart;   for (int i=0; i<multiEditor.getEditorCount(); i++) {      IEditorPart nestedEditor = multiEditor.getEditor(i);      if (nestedEditor!=null) {         IEditorInput nestedInput=nestedEditor.getEditorInput();         // if the nested input matches the desired file to open,         // just activate the multi editor intead of creating a new instance.      }   }}I am marking this as major because it will be a serious usability issue for the incoming multi-source PDE editors. Dan, please look at this request and check if it will cause problems with your editors that extend MultiPageEditorPart. If you are for it, please add your vote - it is very important for PDE editors that handle multiple files. Marking this as an enhancement.  Just to get a feel for priority: how many people have complained about this besides Jeff?  Is this something that is needed for 3.0.x, 3.1 or beyond?   This will become a big problem as more and more people start creating plugins with the new format (i.e. with the OSGi manifest.mf file).  I can easily see people open the manifest.mf file (pde editor #1) and then, out of habit or curiosity, they would want to see what goes into the plugin.xml file(editor #2).  Bring in the build.properties file into the equation and now you have three editors open on the same file.  It has happened me a hundred times.So it's not of those only-Jeff scenarios (and believe me there exists several only-Jeff scenarios :-), it will be a common source of confusion as we move into 3.1 when users would have become more educated about the new runtime and PDE tooling will start ""promoting"" the creation of plug-ins with manifest.mf instead of labeling this option as ""for advanced users only"" as it is for 3.0. cc my good friend Jeff as I referenced his name several times in my previous comment and I don't like to talk about people behind their backs. Glad to see it was used accurately... ;-)  some points.- This should be a 3.1 issue.- The current situation is quite confusing and will only get worse- Other scenarios include any multi resource model objects (e.g., elements in the web space etc etc)- This may impact usecases in the logical to physical world (BTW, Wassim, you should likely talk to Jean-Michel about PDE as a use case for the logical-physical work) See also bug 74263.Note that the workbench proper currently has no knowledge aboutMultiPageEditorPart.  MultiPageEditorPart was designed to use public workbenchAPI as much as possible (there are some exceptions in that it needs to implementsite interfaces which are currently internal), and without the workbench havingto have special case support for it.  While we want to expand the support for nesting parts, this should be donethrough more general API rather than adding special case hacks forMultiPageEditorPart. >I can easily see people open the manifest.mf file (pde editor #1) and then, >out of habit or curiosity, they would want to see what goes into the >plugin.xml file(editor #2).  Bring in the build.properties file into the >equation and now you have three editors open on the same file.  It has >happened me a hundred timesI don't see what the problem is.  These three editors should be sharing the same in-memory document.  What is the difference to the user if a file is opened as a page in a multi-page editor, or as a new editor?  The only difference should be where the Tab appears which allows you to switch to that file.How is the proposed change going to address multiple WorkbenchWindows?  If I do the above steps, but I open each file in a different WorkbenchWindow, then you still have the same problem that a file will be edited by 3 different editors.  The live document must be shared across editors anyway, so that makes this proposal not so critical. See bug 64763 comments 6 and 7.

53574	A missing optional plugin causes low-level Assert exception	"I saw this on the I20040226 build. If an optional plugin (that is, marked as optional=true in 'requires' element, is in fact not present, a low-level Assert exception occurs during descriptor.getPluginPrerequisites(). I stumbled across this testing something completely un-related, but since in the base stack you probably don't have optional plugins which are not present, thought you might appreciate the report. [BTW, its actually in Hyades plugins that has an optional plugin which really is not (normally) intended to be present). I'm not sure what the right solution is .. either ignore it (and return what is there) or return a special descriptor that is marked as ""missing optional plugin"". I'll attach test case and instructions, but here's the instructions (not sure you'll even need the test code is so easy to reproduce). Description:	TestPlugin has the test code (see testPluginPrereqs())	TestPlugin 'requires' RequiringPlugin	RequiringPlugin *optionally* 'requires OptionalPluginInstructions for reproducing1. Select TesterPlugin2. Run as ... Junit Plugin TestAll is ok (test passes). Now, remove (delete or close) OptionalPluginre-run steps 1 and 2, and you'll see Assert.isNotNull exception throw deep in internal.plugins code. Created attachment 8291Three simply pluigns to help demonstrate the bug. We certainly do appreciate reports in ""unusual"" situations.I tried this test case on i0310 and was not able to get the problem (with or without the optional plugin installed).  Note that I do have a problem (sometimes) at the end of the test with the workers not being shutdown properly but I do not beleive that that issue is related.Do you happen to remember where the assert was? I can not reproduce now, in either build! If it helps, the method where the exception was thrown was in 	public IPluginPrerequisite[] getPluginPrerequisites()I believe it was the line:BundleDescription description = Platform.getPlatformAdmin()      .getState(false).getBundle(bundleOsgi.getBundleId());But don't recall for sure ... the Exception was an Assert failure ... something could not be null I think. (I didn't write it down since I could reproduce it so easily! silly me). I do notice now, that all three come back as ""resolvedPrerequisites"" whether the optional one is deleted or not. I guess that's normal?Its a mystery to me! But feel free to 'close' from my point of view. Just tring to give some more data points.  closing.  cannot reproduce.

53541	F: Provide extensible and more flexible filtering in navigators	"Valentina, please assign to me.Currently, the filtering in the Hyades navigators is hardcoded. A common mechanism for all Hyades navigators should be provided. This will be done via an extension point element <filterSet .../> under the <navigatorExtensions .../> extension point. This extension specify a label, icon, navigatorID, implementation, and will allow filters to be declared as common, which means they appear directly in the navigator view's menu, and whether the filter set is enabled by default.This functionality will be placed at the INavigator level, and will apply to all Hyades navigators. Content providers will be wrapped in a FilteredTreeContentProvider, which will consult all filterSet extensions and take care of the filtering.The interface should also be updated to comply with the Hyades UI guidelines. Filters should also be general, and can include a broad category of items (hence the name filter set), rather than a single item type (e.g. Monitor). Curtis please check if the Working Set/Filters approach is more appropiate here instead of a Hyades custom Filter Set. Just to follow the current Eclipse way (see Package and Navigator views). Working sets apply only to specific (existing) items, rather than general categories of items, or types of items. This can be added in the future. Will consult with Wayne about this and open a separate defect if needed.As far as filtering, there is no standard ""Filters..."" item for navigators, or filters dialog. What Eclipse provides is a ViewerFilter, which works at the Viewer level. The Navigator and Package Explorer have their own extension points, Filters menus and dialogs, and use ViewerFilters. We will have to do the same. However, ViewerFilters make it somewhat complicated to filter out an item without filtering out its children. Investigating further.. Curt, we already have a set of profiling set ecxtension points, make sure that your new extension point name doesn't collide with what we have. Finished.

Steps to reproduce involve (but are not so easy):- have custom background (or foreground color) in Java editor- move or rename the document in a way that the caret gets moved by the rename  and that this causes horizontal or vertical scrollingThe bug is as follows: in cases where the editor gets reused (e.g. if reuse isenabled or a file gets renamed or moved) we call unconfigure() and configure()on the viewer. We dispose the text widget's foreground and background colors inJavaSourceViewer.unconfigure() which later during configure() can cause anexception if the text widget's foreground or background color  is accessedbefore it has been set again (in JavaSourceViewer.configure()). *** Bug 77962 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** Verified in code of I20050217-2000 that the fix is in place.

53529	"Allow bypassing ""workspace in use"" check for RCP applications"	"I would like to be able to specify a commandline option (say, ""-concurrentOk"")or some other mechanism that would allow running multiple instances using thesame workspace simultaneously.  Without this ability, RCP applications willoften need to be wrappered with some cumbersome launch mechanism that eithero creates a new workspace for each instance (probably losing any chance of  persisting state), oro implements some mechanism for rendezvousing with an already-running instance  of the app.If such an option were supported, I believe it would be acceptable to followa ""last writer wins"" policy when it comes time to save the application state. The Eclipse kernel is actually being restructured to not require a workspace atall.  However, the vast majority of plugins will still need a workspace, and wecan't dictate that they tolerate multiple concurrent instances. It is not assimple as ""last one wins"", since one instance writing metadata while another isreading can crash instances and permanently corrupt metadata.  Your proposedchange would offload a great deal of responsibility onto every plugin that usesthe metadata area (and they would likely end up needing to introduce locks oftheir own).CC Jeff in case you have further comments. In effect this is now possible.  As John mentioned, the runtime is trying to stop using the instance area (aka workspace in the IDE context).  We only use the instance area if some one calls API which uses the instance area (e.g., getStateLocation()).We are also getting out fo the business of locking, checking, setting the instance area.  The new API is around Platform.getInstanceLocation().  This gives back a Location.  This location can be locked, read, ...  The IDE scenario is to come up, prompt the user for the location of the workspace, then lock it, verify that it is the right version etc etc and continue running.RCP applications can choose to lock or not lock, check or not check, ...I think that this functionality will address your usecases.

For any existing launch configuration type, Hyades should not be responsible for implementing any additional launch shortcut for profile mode. The existing launch shortcuts should be enabled for the ""profile"" mode. This is because the ""profile"" mode is not Hyades-specific, and is defined at the Eclipse platform level (it is one of the three fundamental modes: ""run"", ""debug"", ""profile""). So, they should be handling this mode even if Hyades didn't exist. Launch shortcuts aren't mode-specific; that is, there shouldn't be any mode-specific launching happening therein (this should be delegated to the platform via DebugUITools.launch(...)).As for any new types we define, we should implement our own launch shortcuts, and specify any modes that make sense (even if we don't implement them, it doesn't cost us anything). An exception might be the ""Attach - Java Process""; I don't see how we can automatically launch without knowing the host, port, and agent. Users can't ""open"" an agent in an editor or have one selected before they are attached to it (at least not to my knowledge). Thank you CurtStanley, please open a defect against Eclipse Hi all,Defect has been opened against Eclipse/JDT UI, bugzilla #53736, requesting that the existing launch shortcut also handle the profile mode. I also opened a defect on the PDE for the runtime workbench launch shortcut.https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=53782 About the External Java Application shortcut, I'm not sure it would really be useful to have this. The difference with this one and Java Application is that it supports launching from outside the workspace, as well as inside the workspace but not in java projects and source folders. Since you can only browse _within_ the workspace in the navigator, the only added benefit of this shortcut would be the ability to launch java and class files and JARs outside the build path. But, clearly we can't handle java files that have not been compiled, or whose class files we can't find. This essentially leaves class files and JAR files.So the question is whether this is worth the effort or not. The implementation would involve searching the workspace, determining whether a class file has a main (somehow), and possibly decompressing a JAR file to read its manifest. What do you think, Valentina? *** Bug 53898 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** Correction: It is not the launch configuration type's responsibility to specify the ""profile"" mode, but the profiler's. See Darin's post in #53736. This is because the default launch configuration attributes have to be set, and it cannot be assumed that the profiler uses the same attributes as with run/debug.However, there is currently no feasible way to implement launch shortcuts in ""profile"" without using JDT internal API. Darin lists 3 options:* Open a new feature request or re-open this feature request as enhancement aksing for new API (likely will not happen in 3.0).* Subclass the internal stuff knowning that you will be broken, but hope for API in a future release.* Contribute a fixFor now, we can subclass the internal launch shortcuts. I have opened a new request for API. See #54072. *** Bug 56400 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** Curt, can this be done for M9 ? I believe it can. Done.Implemented new shortcuts that support the profile mode. Extending the existing shortcuts for run/debug required a workaround, because it is currently not possible to 'extend' toolbar launch shortcuts to a new perspective. The shortcuts had to be redefined in our plugin.xml in run, debug modes (separately from profile) without contextual launch support. This is because the toolbar menu is perspective-based, and the context menu is not. Requested better extensibility in #54072.

53523	[Font/Colour] Coolbar background bug	Eclipse 200403010010The workbench is setting a background color in the CoolBar but not in itschildren (ToolBar controls).On Windows (with the manifest), Coolbar by default has a gradient background andToolbar background is transparent. My guess is that workbench don't want thegradient background (or maybe just want a different color) on the CoolBar, so itsets a backgrond on the CoolBar, since the Toolbar is transparent it shows itsparent's (CoolBar) background thru.On GTK, probably other platforms as well, the ToolBar is not tranparent. So theCoolbar gets it background changed to a specific color and the ToolBar remainswith the default one. Testing with different GTK themes one can see weirdcombinations of colors in the CoolBar and its children (hint: the only visualCoolBar part is the CoolItem's gripper).I don't know what is the right answer for this problem. But, some possible(untested) solutions are:1) Stop changing the CoolBar's background2) Also setting the ToolBars' background to match the CoolBar's backgroundAnyhow, I didn't look at UI code to prove what I'm saying is correct so I mightbe complete out for lunch. Billy: Yet another to poke around with....  moving to me.  billy I might as you to double check some things on GTK use of SWT.FLAT for coolbar and toolbar is making them consistent now, no longer setting the background. 	2012-07-09 11:21:38	1341850000.0	resolved wontfix	f54bb45	1341860000.0	modules/jdbc-pool/src/main/java/org/apache/tomcat/jdbc/pool/PoolConfiguration.java

53498	EclipseStarter should not alway refreshPackages	"EclipseStarter.loadBasicBundles() attempts to install the base bundles and then always does a refreshPackages() on the base bundles even when no actual installs have occurred.  This is causing most all bundles installed on the platform to be refreshed each startup even when nothing has changed.  This is pretty expensive.  Should try change it so it only does a refreshPackages if something has changed. I'm not sure that this is a big deal.  The code installs bundles only if they need to be installed. Then passes the list of bundles it just installed to refreshPackages.  I did not go in great detail but typically that list should be empty or full of nulls.  The net effect should be a near noop.In actual fact, a thread is forked and likely some work is done.  I have added a simple test to not call refresh if installBundle() was not called.To be released after tomorrow's I build Your fix will probably address the issue.  But the current code in EclipseStarter.loadBasicBundles does end up passing an array of the four basic bundles to refresh packages every startup whether installBundle() was called or not.  This is because we create a Bundle[] and fill it will bundles that are either already installed or with newly installed bundles with the call:	// don't need to install if it is already installed	bundles[i] = getBundleByLocation(location);	if (bundles[i] != null)		continue;	bundles[i] = context.installBundle(location);This Bundle[] is then always passed to refreshPackages.  This is rather expensive because most every plugin is dependent on one of the four basic bundles. d'oh, I was misreading the code and thought that nulls were being put in the bundle array for ones that were already installed.  My fixed does appear to eliminate the actual calls to refreshPackages on second run.

Fixed.Now users have getCommentList(), getExtendedStartPosition(ASTNode) and getExtendedLength(ASTNode) accessible on org.eclipse.jdt.core.dom.CompilationUnit.[jdt-core-internal]Implementation of CommentMapper heuristic done in org.eclipse.jdt.core.dom.DefaultCommentMapper.Note that Scanner has been modified to store only the text of line comments and not trailing '\r' and '\n' characters. This is internal table of Scanner which has been impacted but have a side on IMethod.getSourceRange() when the node has a trailing line comment as it will length 2 characters less...Test cases added in jdt.core.tests.dom.ASTConverterJavadocTest Here are some additional information on this feature implementation...Unlike ASTNode#getStartPosition() and ASTNode#getLength() the extended source range may include comments and whitespace immediately before or after the normal source range for the node.The compilation unit will now store a instance of DefaultCommentMapper which will be initialized when the compilation unit is converted into DOM/AST nodes hierarchy (see ASTConverter.convert(CompilationUnitDeclaration, char[])).For each node of hierarchy, the comment mapper will look for leading and trailing comments. If some exist, then store their indexes (first and last) in corresponding tables.When user request extended range to compilation unit for a node, it requests it from its DefaultCommentMapper which searches in its tables possible leading and/or trailing comments. Returns start position of first leading comments for extended start position or node start position if no leading comments was found.Returns length including last trailing comments for extended length or node length if no trailing comments was found. Here are also some details on the heuristic implemented in DefaultCommentMapper for leading and trailing comments.:1) for leading comments, it searchs first comment before node start position. Then it goes up in comments list until one of the following condition is true:  - comment is over previous end  - there's other than white characters between current node and comment  - there's more than 1 line between current node and commentIf all these conditions are false, then found comment becomes current node and loop with previous comment.If at least one potential comment has been found, then no token should be on the same line before, so remove all comments which do not verify this assumption.If finally there is a subset of comments, then store start and end indexes in leading comments table.2) for trailing comments, it searchs first comment after node end position. Then it goes down in comments list until one of the following condition is true:  - comment is after next start  - there's other than white characters between current node and comment  - there's more than 1 line between current node and commentIf all these conditions are false, then found comment becomes current node and loop with next comment.If at least one potential comment has been found, then last comment should be separated from next start line (ie. at least two lines after). If this is not the case then skip all comments which were not on the same line than the end of the node.If finally there is a subset of comments, then store start and end indexes in trailing comments table.

53430	Additional fixes for porting SWT to 64-bit	"Creating separate bug as requested in bug 37775.I have made additional changes to SWT-N20040228 to address some problemsoccuring when using SWT on the amd64 platform. With the patches attached I amnow able to get the first window of Eclipse-N20040228 up and running.There are all kinds of fixes, including changes in the glue .c files - althoughI understand these are automatically generated? There are changes made toparameters, return values, size constants and pointer arithmetics using the samestandard as the other changes ( int -> long /*int*/ ).btw, I was thinking that being able to get conversion warnings from both C andJava compilers when an implicit conversion from int to long is taking placewould be of great help, wouldn't it? Wouldn't that pinpoint possible problem areas?Anyways, I plan to continue with getting Eclipse going on 64-bit. If I come upwith new patches, should I attach them here as well or open a new bug? Created attachment 8254Patches for swt source files in SWT-N20040228 Created attachment 8255Patches for swt-pi source files in SWT-N20040228 Just checked SWT-N20040301 and it only contains some changes to os.c - note thatthe changes made to the function type return value is still needed. Created attachment 8256Patches for swt source files in SWT-N20040228 (rev 2)Reattaching patch without debug entry in Display.java. Created attachment 8259atches for swt source files in SWT-N20040228 (rev 3)Status report: with these latest patches I am able to run Eclipse 3.0M7 withoutany major problems! I am not even close to an exhaustive run-through, but Ihave created new projects with source files, edited and run them through thedebugger. The only problems I am seeing are complaints like these in .log:!ENTRY org.eclipse.jdt.core 4 4 Mar 02, 2004 00:19:25.658!MESSAGE Background Indexer Crash Recovery!STACK 0java.lang.InternalError	at java.util.zip.Inflater.end(Native Method)	at java.util.zip.Inflater.end(Inflater.java:294)	at java.util.zip.ZipFile.close(ZipFile.java:369)	atorg.eclipse.jdt.internal.core.search.indexing.AddJarFileToIndex.execute(AddJarFileToIndex.java:185)	atorg.eclipse.jdt.internal.core.search.processing.JobManager.run(JobManager.java:344)	at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:534)I have seen this before and I see the possibility that this is actually anissue with the JDK (Blackdown 1.4.2rc1). Since there are rumours that a new JDKrelease is on the way, I am waiting to test that before spending any more timeon it.New patches are mainly signature changes to callback methods. Thanks Johan. Your patch captures many of the remaining changes that need to go in. I'll go through each one of the changes and put them in.Question about your patch - did you use Eclipse to generate it? they start with N20040228/org/eclipse/swt/widgets/Display.java instead of - i believe - org.eclipse.swt/Eclipse SWT/gtk/org/eclipse/swt/widgets/Display .You can continue to post the patches here.>btw, I was thinking that being able to get conversion warnings from both C and>Java compilers when an implicit conversion from int to long is taking place>would be of great help, wouldn't it? Wouldn't that pinpoint possible problem >areas?Agree... In response to comment 5: this sounds great! Well, I guess I did my own setup to link together the eclipse source code to the 64 bit code. I wanted a setup that could manage to update eclipse and gtk64 code without disturbing each other. I now have a setup where a script produces symbolic links in the eclipse distribution replacing build files to introduce the x86_64 platform (which I guess will be amd64 later on). There are also symbolic links to the source directories made up out of the gtk64 source code. I am not sure how you have planned to get the 64 bit code into the big tree in the end - I guess the 64 bit support should really go in other os/ws combinations as well.The actual answer to your question in comment 6 though: the diffs are produced against each directory tree as they are stored in the zip-files in the gtk64 source distribution (the swtsrc.zip, swt-pisrc.zip and swt-mozillasrc.zip files). So I would suggest creating a directory for each zip, uncompress and then apply the patch from the parent directory. Then you can just add symbolic links from your eclipse tree to get to them.You may laugh or cry, but so far I have not used Eclipse for doing any of the work so far... ;o)  Just plain ant, gdb, emacs and a good deal of tracing. One of these days I want to understand how to get the Eclipse source into Eclipse as a project with build and debug support - do you know of any how-to-doc's on that?I did start out looking at the mozilla code, but I realized that is just too much to get into at this point. Those virtual table calls didn't look like that much fun to do manually - I hope you got some automagic scripts or something for those... We have had another pass of 64 bit refactoring. This should include the changes in the attached patches.

53450	Bug with DebugModelContextBindings	"I am using jdk build 1.4.2-b28 on linux. After Migration from M6 to M7 I got anexception, probably because my DebugModel does not extend theDebugModelContextBindings extension point.The source of the error seems to be in LaunchView::showViewsForCurrentSelection1:if (contextIds.isEmpty() && selection instanceof IStackFrame) {2:  String contextId = contextListener.getDebugModelContext(((IStackFrame)selection).getModelIdentifier());3:  contextIds.add(contextId);4:	5:}6: if (!contextIds.isEmpty()) {7:     Set set= new HashSet();8:     set.addAll(contextIds);			  9: contextListener.getContextManager().setEnabledContextIds(set);10:}contextId in line 2 is null and null is added to contextIdsThe guard clause in line 6 fails andcontextListener.getContextManager()setEnabledContextIds(set) is called where theexception occurs.If I prevent adding null to contextIds, the code works. Thanks for catching this.Incidentally, if you're implementing a debugger, you're encouraged to use the new context-related extension points and give us feedback in the near future. :) Fixed in LaunchView by adding the missing null check.Please verify, Luc. Indeed, I am implementing a debugger for ruby ;-)(http://sourceforge.net/projects/rubyeclipse). As far as I understand the newextension it allows to display/undisplay views depending on the debug model.Currently the jdt uses the display view as such an extension. After debugging ajava application and then debugging a ruby application I expected the displayview to disappear. It did not and after checking the plugin I assume that theautoClose=false prevents the view from being closed. What am I expected to do ifI want to provide a ruby specific display view (and want the java display viewto disappear)? Currently I am reusing the java display view where I added a menuaction for ""ruby inspect"", so the question is more or less academical.But I would really appreciate a solution for the debug action groups. I have aRuby Action Group and a Java Action Group. Couldn't the extension automaticallychoose the appropriate action groups? E.g. I have actions in the Ruby ActionGroup for menu items in the variable view and want them only displayed if a rubystack frame is selected. As far as I could tell, currently the user has tochange preferences>Run/Debug>Debug Action Groups in order to change the behaviour.thanksMarkus Marking as verified.Adding Jared as CC for the last comment from Markus.

53266	[CellEditors] ComboBoxCellEditor dismissed on first click in Properties View	When you click in the properties view on an entry that uses a ComboBoxCellEditor it will activate the cell editor correctly, but when you try to click on the dropdown, the cell editor is dismissed.  You then need to click again to activate the cell editor again, and then you need to click the dropdown again, which fortunately works the second time.  Any property that uses a ComboBoxCellEditor needs to be clicked four times to access the dropdown the first time.  Every time a new input is passed to the properties view, the behavior is reset and four clicks are necessary yet again.One place to reproduce this is in the PDE's .exsd editor.  EMF relies heavily on the properties view, so this problem is a serious usability regression that needs to be addressed before 3.0 is final.

My issue is that the background color for the selection looks very similar to the normal background color for code assist. This makes it very difficult to determine what code assist option you are selecting. ""Completion proposal background"" and ""Completion proposal foreground"" refer to the whole popup window. SWT does not provide a way to change the selection color for inividual controls other than StyledText. Changing the popup window's colors give you a way to achieve an acceptable contrast.  I agree that changing the overall background/foreground will allow to a better contrast, however I don't see a reason why SWT does not provide for either 1) Changing the selected option foreground/background, or 2) Using the default system colors for these items. Every other list box in Eclipse uses the system highlight color. I understand this may be more work than its worth.

Everything seems fine.The test is marshalling arguments and calling the server.The server says: unmarshal exception.Probable reason: i have configured the source of whole project in eclipse.Eclipse recompiles everything and uses its own compiled classes.That may differ slightly from the classes/libraries on the server.So I get the unmarshal exception. O.k. I could remove the source entry anduse the correct library instead, but then I can not analyse and refactor all sources anymore and I do not want to create a new project for debugging and for developing. (Besides that I already have to makea new eclipse project for each version control branch, and we have many branches. This could be solved by a separate feature request.)So I would like to be able to add the source to the project buttell eclipse to take the library and neverless show the source at debugging.If you think this features request is reasonable,perhaps you can give it a reasonable name, too.best regardsThorsten van Ellen Not for 3.0 As of now 'LATER' and 'REMIND' resolutions are no longer supported.Please reopen this bug if it is still valid for you. 	2012-04-03 21:41:35	1333500000.0	resolved fixed	957d33b	1338940000.0	java/org/apache/jasper/JspC.java

53354	"can not launch ""runtime workbench"""	"Using M7 as a development environment, I can not run ""Run ... runtime workbench"" with last weeks integration build (I20040226) as the target. I get the following message in log. I marked as ""blocker"" since I'd think this would be a common way of doing development on Eclipse (that is, use milestone build as development platform, and latest integration build as target). I would be surprised if not already found, but I couldn't find existing bugzilla. A workaround would be appreciated. BTW ... using just the integration build, and launching runtime workbench seems to work fine. !SESSION ----------------------------------------------------------------------!ENTRY org.eclipse.core.launcher 4 0 Feb 28, 2004 21:17:37.924!MESSAGE Exception launching the Eclipse Platform:!STACKjava.lang.IllegalStateException: Bundle reference:file:D:/builds/Daily/eclipse-SDK-3.0M7-win32/eclipse/workspace/org.eclipse.osgi.util/ [2] is not active	at org.eclipse.core.runtime.adaptor.EclipseStarter.ensureBundlesActive(EclipseStarter.java:123)	at org.eclipse.core.runtime.adaptor.EclipseStarter.run(EclipseStarter.java:93)	at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)	at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(Unknown Source)	at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(Unknown Source)	at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Unknown Source)	at org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.basicRun(Main.java:279)	at org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.run(Main.java:742)	at org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.main(Main.java:581) In the I build the pde, update and some part of runtime have been reorganized insuch a way that they are mot compatible with M7.Use your I build as your dev environment.Please close as invalid if it works for you. Well ... it might work for me personally, but I'm just a small part of a large team. So, are you saying that everyone who wants to ""keep up"" with integration builds, has to start doing development with an integration build as their development environment?! This seems a little dangerous, since I builds are not completly stable and not completely tested (by definition). Or are you saying there's no easy work around at the moment ... but there is still efforts being made to fix this incompatibility by the next integration build? If no hope of being compatible, then we (as a large team) have two alternatives, either all move up to do developement on potenitally unstable I builds, or all sit back and wait for M8 (and get further out of synch with base) ... neither seem like good alternatives, so I'm reluctant to close as invalid.  Your concerns are valid however there is not much we can do about this.  The new function/structure we are putting in place needs more/different information than the older environments can offer.  As I'm sure you can appreciate, it is very difficult for us to manage our code and artifacts to capture the vision for 3.0 if we have to maintain N iterations of the structure we did along the way.  As was noted, this issue is not specific to the runtime.  At least several components have conspired to break things all at once :-/As for what you should do, I suggest moving to the latest I builds.  There are problems to be sure but we all use them and are not losing data or crashing. I'm going to close this.  If someone can offer up the relevant fixes or take some other work we can reopen but we just don't have the cycles. Jeff, can the PDE not organize itself so that part of its functionality/implementation is provided by the *TARGET* version of Eclipse, instead of the developement version? Or perhaps they could provide fragments for each target runtime, but that blows up pretty quick.It seems like this is the only way to prevent this in the future.  After all, Eclipse is an extensible IDE, and it would be naive to think that developers do not have lots of custom tools installed and running in their development environment.  The extreme case is people who use WSAD to develop for WSAD. moving to PDE 'cause I know it will make Wassim happy... In M7, update.configurator expects ""platform.cfg"" and PDE generates one for it.In 0226, update.configurator expects ""platform.xml"" and PDE generates one for it.You are using M7 as a host platform to target a 0226 (a later build). I'm not sure why you expect PDE in M7 to be forward-compatible.  I'm no psychic on what the future holds for update.configurator ;-)In your scenario, you are using M7, so PDE generates a ""platform.cfg"", which is not understood by 0226's update.configurator.Note that update and core runtime are still moving targets and PDE is not expected and cannot be expected to provide backward compatibility on a build-date granularity level.While we acknowlege the inconvenience this may have caused you, there is nothing that can be done in this case.  There is a breaking point where update.configurator changed its platform config file format.PDE provides backward-compatiblity with 2.x releases, and that's as far as backward compatibility goes. So there is something in 0226 which knows how to generate a ""platform.xml"" file. So the suggestion was that you make that functionality visible to the older IDE (M7), so that it could know how to launch 0226.  Or better yet, it actually asks 0226 to launch iteself.Obviously you can't do this after the fact and I don't expect an M7.0.1 release.  But, going forward you could take this approach to avoid the problem the future.  That way Eclipse R3.0 could be used to develop for Eclipse 4.0. I have to agree with Randy on this one.  In our case there are plugins we require for development that have not been upgraded to a 3.0 base.  We have no choice but to stay back a level for our workbench, but we are required to launch, debug, certify our work on 3.0.  It's untenable.  As more tools are acquired from more sources, workbenches are going to be held back by their weakest link.  This is going to be a much more common scenario.  Its akin to requiring that all nodes of a network be upgrade the same level of software at the same time which is something we all know customers will not accept. I don't understand why you think that forward-compatibility on the part of PDE is feasible and expected.The suggestion made by Randy in comment #7 is simply impossible.Let's use Randy's R3.0 and R4.0 hypothetical scenario as an example:When we ship R3.0, update.configurator (from the Update component) expects a platform.xml file that it could launch successfully, and PDE generates one for it.Let's say in R4.0, the Update team decided to go with an (arbitrary) platform.ini file instead of platform.xml.  PDE in R4.0 could adapt to that change and be even backward-compatible so that it could be used to target R3.0 patforms.On the other hand, PDE 3.0 could not have foreseen these breaking changes obviously, so what could have possibly been done in the 3.0 development cycle to account for the future unforseen breaking change?  Nothing.Randy is suggesting that 3.0PDE could call 4.0 update.configurator (from the target platform) to have it generate the correct configuration file.How is that possible?  The host platform instance (3.0) and its plugins don't have plugins from the target platform on their runtime classpath.  The only update.configurator a 3.0 PDE would have on its classpath is the one that was shipped with it.  It cannot call APIs from the 4.0 update.configurator in the target platform. In other words, PDE will always require that the target platform be the same or older than PDE itself. This is a perfectly reasonable requirement - the self-hosting Eclipse is typically the latest stable build from Eclipse.org and as long as it is backward-compatible with previous releases, all is well. It seems there are 2 possibilities (other than doing nothing):1) Support N+1 hosting. Provide a 2.1.x version of PDE which can launch a 3.0 version of Eclipse.  Worst case you double your work load.  The alternative is that users wait for every tool they have installed to support the latest version of eclipse before they themselves can do so.2) I thought bundles could come from anywhere.  In fact, I though I saw a demo at EclipseCon where a ""plugin"" was loaded over a network instead of from the plug-ins folder.  Could you not use the new runtime support to do what you said is impossible? Dynamically define a bundle in the target runtime and ask core to activate it? Regarding solution #1:Maybe I just can't relate to the workflow that requires forward compatibility.  Once upon a time when I was on the WSADIE team, I remember using the latest and greatest lightweight Eclipse to target my product that was based on a previous version of Eclipse.  I don't remember anybody using a platform as their host workbench that is older than the target platform.Plus, in this proposed solution, which would require a double work load at worst, I'm not sure this so-called patch really fits the criterion of a critical fix that should go into a service release.  So I can't see it happening.Regarding solution #2:Although it is technically possible in the Eclipse of tomorrow to point at a bundle and dynamically install it, two main problems come to mind immediately:1. When you install update.configurator 4.0 dynamically, the 3.0 counterpart gets deactivated and who knows what the ramifications of this might be.  There is no guarantee there is binary compatibility between update.configurator 4.0 and the rest of the Update plug-ins in 3.0.  Spend a day with the Update team, and see what happens if people start mixing plug-ins themselves.  You could end up with a pretty messy configuration.2. Back to the whole crystal ball thing, you are making the assumption that the plug-in needed to read the configuration file is always going to be update.configurator.  What if they change it to something else?  After all, the name did change between 2.x and 3.0.  PDE simply can't make assumptions and predictions about future platforms and what plug-ins to dynamically install. ""when I was on the WSADIE"".  You were at the bottom of the stack, and there was significant lag in what your target version of eclpise was and what was ""latest and greatest"".  In addition, WSAD has reduced the lag time and is very much in-step with the workbench.  Also, the number of add-in tools has increased over time.""When you install update.configurator 4.0 dynamically, the 3.0 counterpart gets deactivated and who knows what the ramifications of this might be""Obviously this would have to be split into 2 pieces. the 3.0 counterpart would never even get loaded since that is not the target runtime. One piece is would be contant and part of the IDE, and it would load the dynamic second piece from the target IDE. I suppose if I went into preferences and changed my target platform, then at that point the portion provided by the target runtime would get shutdown and swapped out.

Alain,It is not the getChildren() that is broken. It is just that the CView is not asked to refresh its TreeView except with a save. We just need to ask it to refresh with each reconcile, just like with the outline view.Changing the title to be more accurate. > We just need to ask it to > refresh with each reconcile, just like with the outline view.Yes, I see what you mean.But is this the right approach?  The CEditor is tied withthe Outliner it is easy to call the update on the outliner whenthe buffer is dirty.  Not so easy for the CView and other listeners.Actually, I think you have some commented code that deal with thisin WorkingCopy.reconcile(..),  CElementDeltaBuilder is call andan ICElementDelta is sent to all the listeners.This is how it is done now in the JDT. The outliner is no longera special case. Oh my God ! you know the code by heart :-)I think you are right. It was not enough to broadcast the reconcile event to all listener (the commented code you were talking about). It was also important to get the children of a translation unit using its working copy if it has one. Of course, unlike the outliner, we can not assume that every translation unit has an associated working copy in the CView.I have a patch to submit, but I need to test it well and try it on Linux first. I do not want the flickering problem to come back.Thanks for all your advice Alain. 	2012-04-13 13:45:11	1334340000.0	resolved fixed	098a647	1337960000.0	java/org/apache/catalina/websocket/StreamInbound.java java/org/apache/coyote/ajp/AjpAprProtocol.java java/org/apache/coyote/http11/Http11AprProtocol.java java/org/apache/coyote/http11/upgrade/UpgradeAprProcessor.java java/org/apache/coyote/http11/upgrade/UpgradeBioProcessor.java java/org/apache/coyote/http11/upgrade/UpgradeInbound.java java/org/apache/coyote/http11/upgrade/UpgradeNioProcessor.java java/org/apache/tomcat/util/net/AprEndpoint.java

Jeff, when does the runtime spit out such a message? This is actually coming from ConfigurationActivator.installBundles().It would be good to know more about the original configuration.  Like what is the name of the plugin?  is that the ""test"" part? I have also seen that at one of the code clinics.Launching using the same configuration and same set of plug-ins, one time were seeing a lot of those messages, and then on a subsequent identical launch two seconds later, everything was fine. > It would be good to know more about the original configuration.  Like what is the name of the plugin?  is that the ""test"" part?I created a project called 'test' using a PDE plugin template (editor template). I did not add anything to the project at all. I then created a runtime-workbench 'Run' configuration and ran it.   PDE is passing the correct URL to the plug-in, and update is rejecting it.Moving to Update... I don't have access to a mac, so I tested the following on XP:- create a new project ""test"" using the template that sets up a view- launched a runtime configuration- went to Windows>Show View > Other and picked up the Sample View just created.I did not see any error messages and things worked as expected. I ran this a couple of times, then I also disabled removing the config and ran it a couple of more times. Everything worked fine for me.Moving back to PDE for further investigation or to close it. FYI, I just retried with I20040226 and have exactly the same error. Perhaps Andre could try this on his Mac?Channing Is the the URL reference:file:/workspace/test correct?In other words, do you have a workspace directory sitting at the file system root ? file:/workspace/test is correct. It is the location of the plugin project.Channing The error message you get happens when the update configurator tries to install the bundle using bundleContext.install(""reference:file:/workspace/test/"")and the method throws an exception.Andre, we don't have access to a Mac; could you please the reported scenario on the latest build? Thanks! I encountered the same error using build I20040226 on Win2000.

One thing that PDE is doing differently in the 0302 build is that when pass the URL of the plug-in to Update, we pass the URL to the directory where the plug-in is installed, while in the past we used to pass the URL to the actual plugin.xml file of the plug-in.Not sure if this has to do with anything. closing, as some synergistic effect must have fixed the problem.

53087	Resolver API should expose new names	"The resolver API still uses old names like getUniqueId. It should be alignedwith the Bundle API and say in this case getSymbolicName.There may be other cases like that, I haven't check them all. The FrameworkAdaptor API has the same issues.  I'm working on updating this API. moving to Tom marking as M8 This is still an issue in BundleDescription.getUniqueId().  This should probably be BundleDescription.getSymbolicName().Reassigning to equinox so that we can evaluate the impact of changing this method name since many clients use this API. I have deprecated a number of methods on BundleDescription.  Please take a look and report any issues ASAP.  We plan on removing these before May 7. PDE is using the deprecated getUniqueId() for all the state work.However, I am more than happy to change it, because the old name (getUniqueId()) was confusing the heck out of me, because it was so close to getBundleId(). great.  Let us know when you are off of it.   Update used BundleDescription at some point, to avoid having to startup the bundles. I've, since, realized that using Bundle is ok, as their start() method is not automatically invoked.(I equated Bundle=Plugin and BundleDescription=PluginDescriptor) I replacedd getUniqueId() by getBundleId(), so I am off this one. Dorian, did you mean to say ""replaced getUniqueId() with getSymbolicName()""? No, with getBundleId.I only wanted to test for bundle id == 0 (the framework bundle), although I could use symbolic name and do a string comparison. Jeff, you could remove the deprecated methods at a time of your choosing, I plan to start using getSymbolicName() before midnight. On second thought, if I make the changes now, this would force the rest of the PDE team to check out the osgi plug-ins from HEAD.

As a first step I suggesta) make clicking anywhere in the entire ""gray"" area around the editor tab cause the drop down to appear.  This simplifies aimingb) having some modifier key that just brings up the list at the current mouse position (e.g., Alt and button down or some such)c) accelerators for choosing editors (I looked around but did not see anything in the menus etc)The related issue is choosing by name.  This problems here area) requires you to know/think about the name of the thing you are looking forb) the combo is quite cluttered because the entire path of the file is displayed with little visual separationc) users are unable to leverage their spatial abilities (i.e., I usually just know where the editor I want is but really don't know what the name of the file is)I don't know what to do about this.  Perhaps all that empty space in the fast view docking area can be used to put editor icons with really fast hover help showing the real name.  left unsorted or permitting user arrangement users could develop a spatial model? - you can now left click on the tab to get the drop down. big target.- we are going to add Ctrl+E to bring up this drop down. we took (traded?) it recently from zurich...- erich suggested the format of the path to be ""base - path""- using multiple tabs gives you your spacial option..i'll keep this open for a while, at least until the accelerator is there.. comments matching comment 1 points- great.  That seems to sometimes fail.  Got in a mode in I0302 where I could not get the drop down to show.  Also, what about all that extra empty grey area.  clicking in there does nothing.  That could show the drop down as well.- great as well.  Ideally this would work the same as ctrl-o where the list just shows up somewhere (don't really care where) but I can type and it subsets the available editors until I hit return.  <esc> dismisses.  Further, if that list was in order of creation rather than alphabetical users would get at least some temporal/spatial ordering.- either way it is very cluttered.  Perhaps just more space between the file name and the path?- yes but I cna only ever see about 4-5 tabs at once.  The spatial view does not actually require that much info in the title, just enough for me to understand if I am interested in looking further (i.e., if my spatial memory is not complete).  Anyway, perhaps with the other enhancements this will be less of an issue as I understand it is hard to resolve I see the new ctrl-e dialog in the latest integration build.  Good progress.  I have a couple of comments/questions:- the list of editors is alphabetical.  This is unfortunate since you lose the temporal ordering of when the editors were open.  The temporal order is available since that it what is shown in ctrl-F6.- being able to type in the dialog (and see what you are typing) would be great.  If you know what editor you want you cna just hit ctrl-e then start typing.- the dialog ""feels"" heavy.  The ctrl-o style dialog is feels much leaner and direct.  As does the ctrl-F6 popup.  The current dialog feels more like a grand ""editor manager"". This might be interesting but is a little off putting as a navigation mechanism.- Perhaphs ctrl-e ctrl-e could be used to do some of the management functions.  This is analogous to the JDT IU  ctrl-o ctrl-o behaviour.  The first ctrl-e gets you a clean, simple popup navigation aid.  The second ctrl-e gets you either more function/content in that aid or a different dialog/popup like the current one. The general request of this bug has been addressed in r3.0.

This is available in the options file for Platform UI.  Please set both the debugging and verbose debugging flags to true.  You are not experiencing ""crashes, loss of data, severe memory leak"", so please do not mark the bug as critical.  Downgrading to ""major""....  The PDE launcher is still busted M7 so I cannot enable tracing.  Anyway, you can reproduce quite easily.Here are the steps reproduce. Use the PDE wizard to create a new plug-in project.  Choose the template ""plug-in with View"", and then choose to ues a TreeViewer (which will be deleted later), and deselect all of the unrelated stuff like toolbars, context menus, filters, sorting, whatever.Now, open the generated class ""SampleView"", and change it to read:public class SampleView extends ViewPart {public void createPartControl(Composite parent) {  new Text(parent, SWT.MULTI | SWT.V_SCROLL)      .addKeyListener(new KeyAdapter() {    public void keyPressed(KeyEvent e) {      if (e.character == ' ' && e.stateMask == SWT.CTRL)        ((Text)e.widget).append(""Ctrl+SPACE"");    }});}public void setFocus() {}}Run the runtime workbench and note that CTRL+SPACE is not being received by the view's Text control.  Also, not that COPY/CUT/PASTE do not work either, yet the view has not provided and action handlers for *any* of these actions. a comment in passing (i.e. i didn't think too much about it, so take it with a grain of salt.. ):cut, copy, and paste are 'global' actions, so they are registered on startup (opening a workbench window). [search backwards from WorkbenchWindow.registerGlobalAction to org.eclipse.internal.ide.WorkbenchActionBuilder.makeActions to see this unfold..]that means, for global or 'retargetable' actions, the command manager always thinks there is a handler. (i don't think the workbench window never unregisters global actions.)if a RetargetAction doesn't have a handler in the active part, it simply says its disabled. that doesn't help us down at the command manager. the workbench is not making the distinction between 'unhandled' and 'handled but disabled'.not sure about content assist.. maybe the same problem. i don't think ui registers content assist as a global action, though.anyway, food for thought.. Yup, I was thinking the same thing, which is why I decided not to start off by saying ""come on guys, this is so obvious ... cut/copy/paste has been busted for ages"" :-) So, the second form of this problem is that keystrokes are consumed for commands which ARE registered with a Global Action, BUT for which there is no Action Handler.  This has been around forever, and it is why Undo/Redo/Cut/Copy/Paste do not work inside simple Text controls. Confirmed on Randy's reproduce case from comment #2.  Key binding service recognizes the command identifier ""org.eclipse.ui.edit.copy"", but replies that the command is disabled.  Chris' guess was an alarmingly good one.  I would suggested making getActionHandler public on RetargetAction.  The class is flagged as not intended to be subclassed, and there are only ten descendents in Eclipse.  :)  None of them attempt to override the behaviour of this method.  Now, in ActionHandler, we can make one of those icky downcasts to RetargetAction when appropriate.  This will allow us to distinguish between the disabled and unhandled cases of RetargetAction.   Alternatively, we can make it so that disabled actions don't eat key bindings.  This is more direct, but I think the semantic is backward somehow.  I would expect that if some command were disabled that it wouldn't be allowed to continue to the widget hierarchy -- where it might be interpreted as something else altogether.   How do people feel about these options?  This is being deferred from M8, and will be fixed for the first integration build in M9.  The reasons for deferral at this point is that: + It's too close to M8. + While it does not seem risky, it could have unintentional side effects. + This bug has not been noticed very often.   It will be ready for I200403300800.  I believe this bug is now fixed in CVS.  There were two separate problems.   First of all, I've expanded RetargetAction to expose its internal handler.  ActionHandler and Command now use this extra information (if present) to decide whether a command is *really* handled.  Secondly, the perfect match branch of the press method seemed to contain a logic error.  It said to swallow the key if there *weren't* previous key strokes and a perfect match occurred.  I believe it was intended to be if there *were* previous key strokes.  In general, though, it might be better to remove that check all together.  Really, it might be better if the defined/handled state of a command was all that controlled the eating of keys.  Let me know if you see this problem again/still post-I200403300800.

50860	[interop] NoClassDefFoundError when using SWT_AWT after applying workaround for manifest file	<Pyinson Data Over Head> Created attachment 7628project workspace, sources incl binary pluginZip file contains the plugin workarea, java sources, compiled classes andplugin archive. Described behavior was produced on 3.0M6 build including the recommended workaround to avoid the initial NoClassDefFoundException that was caused by the wrong package name in the manifest file for class SWT_AWT. Plugins that are executed via the runtime-workbench seem to work fine, actually deploying the plugin and restarting the main workbench throws the exception. *** Bug 50878 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** This looks like a problem in the plugin class loader. Moving to core to get more input.  The problem happens because there was a bug in the OSGi manifest for SWT thatshipped with M6. It exported a package org.eclipse.swt.internal.awt, althoughthe right package should be org.eclipse.swt.awt. You didn't get the error while running from Eclipse because you probably had SWTimported from CVS (the manifest was fixed on 20031230) instead of importing fromthe M6 as binary project. Is that correct?So, using a more recent integration build (or manually fixing the manifest forSWT on M6) solves the problem. This is actually a duplicate. Silenio, this has already been reported: bug 49401 and bug 50377. Feel free tomark as duplicate of one of them (BTW: one of them should be marked as duplicateof the other, shouldn't it?). *** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 50377 *** 	2011-03-03 06:51:14	1299150000.0	resolved fixed	e092870	1332260000.0	modules/jdbc-pool/src/main/java/org/apache/tomcat/jdbc/pool/DataSourceProxy.java modules/jdbc-pool/src/main/java/org/apache/tomcat/jdbc/pool/PoolConfiguration.java modules/jdbc-pool/src/main/java/org/apache/tomcat/jdbc/pool/PoolProperties.java modules/jdbc-pool/src/main/java/org/apache/tomcat/jdbc/pool/PooledConnection.java modules/jdbc-pool/src/main/java/org/apache/tomcat/jdbc/pool/jmx/ConnectionPool.java

This could certainly be done a little more cleanly.	/* (non-Javadoc)	 * @see org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core.ISwitchToThread#setCurrentThread(IThread)	 */	public void setCurrentThread( IThread thread ) throws DebugException	{		if ( !isSuspended() || !isAvailable() || thread == null || !(thread instanceof CThread) )		{			return;		}				//		// CS: 02-19-04		//		// If thread selection fails, revert the selection to the old thread		//		CThread oldThread = null;		try		{			oldThread = (CThread)getCurrentThread();			if (oldThread == null || !oldThread.equals( thread ) )			{				if (oldThread != null)				{					oldThread.setCurrent( false );				}				getCDITarget().setCurrentThread( ((CThread)thread).getCDIThread() );				((CThread)thread).setCurrent( true );			}		}		catch( CDIException e )		{			if (oldThread != null)			{				oldThread.setCurrent( true );			}			targetRequestFailed( e.getMessage(), null );		}	}Note that this still calls targetRequestFailed(), and so this in and of itself if not enough to get rid of the dialog box.  I then also modified CDebugUIPlugin to not call errorDialog().  I suspect this is not what you will want to do, but here is the snippet:	/* (non-Javadoc)	 * @see org.eclipse.ui.ISelectionListener#selectionChanged(IWorkbenchPart, ISelection)	 */	public void selectionChanged( IWorkbenchPart part, ISelection selection )	{		if ( selection != null && selection instanceof IStructuredSelection )		{			if ( ((IStructuredSelection)selection).size() == 1 )			{				Object element = ((IStructuredSelection)selection).getFirstElement();				if ( element != null && element instanceof IThread )				{					if ( ((IThread)element).getDebugTarget() instanceof ISwitchToThread )					{						try						{							if ( !sameThread( (IDebugElement)element ) )							{								((ISwitchToThread)((IThread)element).getDebugTarget()).setCurrentThread( (IThread)element );							}						}						catch( DebugException e )						{							//							// CS: 02-19-04 							//							// Don't bring up this error dialog, just fail silently							//							//errorDialog( e.getMessage(), e );						}					}				}				else if ( element != null && element instanceof IStackFrame )				{					if ( ((IStackFrame)element).getThread() instanceof ISwitchToFrame )					{						try						{							if ( !sameThread( (IDebugElement)element ) )							{								((ISwitchToThread)((IStackFrame)element).getDebugTarget()).setCurrentThread( ((IStackFrame)element).getThread() );							}							((ISwitchToFrame)((IStackFrame)element).getThread()).switchToFrame( (IStackFrame)element );						}						catch( DebugException e )						{//							errorDialog( ""Switch to stack frame failed."", e );						}					}				}			}		}	} Does this happen because you have a non-CThread selected in the Debug view? No, the thread becomes initially selected when the attach occurs and the target is suspended.  Then the target is resumed, and a breakpoint is hit.  At this point, the thread that was previously selected really does not exist any more.  I suspect this is some kind of thread having to do with attaching gdb to the process under debug, but I really don't know much about the Windows debug architecture and gdb to validate this ""gut feeling"" Wait, my above comment isn't quite true.  After the process is resumed, I am selecting my launch (the top level in the debug hierarchy).  It implements ISuspendResume, I am resuming it.  So it is the guy that is currently selected when the breakpoint is hit.  It is certainly not a CThread, so I guess the answer to your previous question is, ""yes"" Ok, I'll check both cases. Thanks. I suspect this is a synchronization problem, but I can't reproduce it with the current version. Can you try the latest version from the HEAD or 1.2.1? I can reproduce it in 1.2.1 also.  Remember that my CDT target is not the only thing in my launch, I have non-CDT targets in my launch as well.  I don't know how this might impact things, and obviously would be difficult for you to reproduce. The only place when this can happen is the ""selectionChanged"" method of ""CDebugUIPlugin"". But we always check if the target is an instance of 'ISwitchToThread' or 'ISwitchToFrame'. This should filter out other targets and threads, unless you use the same interfaces.Can you send me a longer trace? The one that starts when program hits the breakpoint.Thanks.BTW, this code (the synchronization of the selected thread and frame with the current thread and frame in gdb) will be removed in 2.0. <Pyinson Data Over Head> PR was not targeted to any particular release. Changing target milestone to 2.1 We don't synchronize the thread selection in the Debug view with the current thread in gdb anymore. Assuming that the problem is gone because the ""ISwitchToThread"" interface no longer exists.

""...I started my 2.1 maintenance workspace...""The problem you described shows that the runtime for 3.0 is being used to startEclipse from Eclipse (not what you want). Can you confirm you have only 2.1.* plugins in your launch configuration (eitherby importing from a 2.1.* install, having a 2.1.* as target platform, orchecking them out from CVS)? I guess I found the problem: the target platform was I20040204 and hence it usedthis one for launching. I changed the target platform to be 2.1.2 and now it works.I can't tell for sure but I think PDE automatically ""updated"" the targetworkspace and launch config. Ok, this is good. I will close this one. Feel free to open a different issueagainst PDE/UI. Agree.FYI: I guess PDE automatically updates the target unless set manually. I did notnotice this since I launch without any external plug-in from the target location(I have everything in the 2.1.2 workspace). BUT: the target seems to have aneffect on the  Run-time launch config behavior itself. There were a number of changes in PDE to handle the new launch requirements for the 3.0 runtime.  PDE detects the flavour of target and uses different techniques depending on the target.  So yes, the nature of your target does affect how the target is launched.As for updating the target automaticaly, you would have ot ask the PDE folks but there is a ""use this applicaiton as the target"" option.  If that is selected, I would expect it to be updated as I change what Eclipse I was using for the dev environment. >but there is a ""use this applicaiton as the target"" option.  If that is Well that's what I did and that preference has gone and this probably triggeredthe error. The ""Use this application"" option was redundant and confusing to users.  PDE is able to determine this implicitly without confusing the user with two options.Your host platform remains equal to your target platform, until you explicitly change the target platform value to a different one.This way, if you launch different instances of Eclipse on the same workspace, every time your worbench opens, your target platform would be adjusted to be equal to your host platform (as if the old option were still there).In your case, you launched a 3.0 platform on a 2.1 workbench, so the target platform is 3.0 and that is why you ran into the error.  No surprises there.  It is the expected behavior since in this workspace, you had the default behavior (target == host).If you do development for a 2.1 platform using a 3.0 host platform, you have to explicitly change the target platform in the preferences.  This is how things work and always have worked. Dani, regarding comment #4, which is what is causing the confusion:To be able to launch, PDE needs to specify the location of startup.jar.  This JAR is the one found in the target platform.So when all your external plug-ins are uncheked, you would be running with workspace plug-ins only as you expect, but with the startup.jar of your target platform.In the case here, the startup.jar is a 3.0 JAR which is incompatible with your 2.1.x workspace plug-ins.  That is why it is necessary to always specify the target platform against which your workspace plug-ins are meant to be deployed, even if all the external plug-ins remain unchecked. Wassim,sounds all fair and I understand the technical implementation when reading yourcomments BUT it is still confusing for a user (at least it was for me): I haveall needed plug-ins in my workspace and when running I have nothing checked fromthe external plug-ins. Since I used 3.0 builds (before OSGi) to launch myself-containing (at least I thought so ;-) 2.1.x workspace I saw no reason whyit should no longer work. Hence I filed the bug report.If there is a dependency to the target location when launching then this shouldbe indicated somewhere in the launch configuration. If your target platform is 3.0, and you did not have any of the osgi plug-ins checked, the launch certainly aborts/should abort with an error message.Are you sure none of the external plug-ins were checked?  If so, then it's a valid bug. also, were any of the osgi plug-ins in your workspace? No external plug-ins checked and no OSGi stuff in the workspace. Sounds like there is something in there with the preference going away.  If the workspace has no OSGi stuff and the target is a 3.0 platform, it should definitely bail.  Should be reasonably easy to reproduce this no? the preference has nothing to do with it.  Theoretically, it should be easy to reproduce.   >and the target is a 3.0 platform,I start with 3.0 but the code in the workspace is 2.1. The target is pointing to3.0. Due to this the Run-time worbench launch config expects osgi stuff - atleast that's what I see. Wassim, I have a question about the new UI: how do I restore the currentapplication as the target platform after it has been changed to something else?It seems I have to find its location by hand (tried leaving the field empty, butit didn't work). Restore defaults didn't work as well. BTW, build is: N20040206. Browsing to the location of your host Eclipse install location ought to do it. Opened separate bug 51391 for this. I imported org.eclipse.jdt.ui and all its pre-reqs from a 2.1.2 build into my workspace.I then changed the target platform to a 3.0 platform.Scenario 1: I disabled all external (3.0) plug-ins.When I tried to launch, the launch aborted with an error dialog saying that several osgi plug-ins are missing, which is the expected behavior that Dani claimed did not see.Scenario 2: I enabled all external (3.0) plug-ins.This time the launch proceeded of course because all the required plug-ins that OSGi requires are found (i.e. they are external and checked).  The workbench failed to start, again as expected, telling you to open the log.  When you open the log, you will see that the 3.0 startup.jar obviously did not like the 2.1.2 core.runtime plug-in in my workspace.Bottom line is that the user should be aware of a target platform really means.In both scenarios however, there were enough details to figure out what is wrong.Dani, you said that PDE allowed the launch to proceed even when all the 3.0 external plug-ins are checked (i.e. you did not get the error dialog).  This is the reason why this bug report is open as PDE should warn if you are missing the crucial osgi plug-ins when launching against a 3.0 target platform.Is there any other subtle yet important detail about your setup that could have caused this? >scenario 1. Where did I say this? If I did so, then sorry - that was wrongthen. But when you look at comment 2 and comment 9 I describe that I have a selfcontaining workspace and cannot launch. Yes the dialog tells me about OSGi stuffwhich is needed. Why? I have a self containing workspace. This only confused mesince the workspace worked for months like a charm.>In both scenarios however, there were enough details to figure out what is >wrong.I disagree ;-) Neither: A ava.lang.IllegalStateException: Unable to acquire application service	at org.eclipse.core.runtime.adaptor.EclipseStarter.run(EclipseStarter.java:100)	at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)	at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:39)nor a dialog that tells me for my 2.1 workspace that OSGi plug-ins are neededare enough detailed information - ok maybe detailed but not user friendly. In my opinion the user doesn't even need to be informed in any detail because he expects his workspace to simply startup. Assume: he never touched the PDEtarget preference and was able to launch up to now, so saying the problem is theuser's side and he should have been smart enough to figure that out is just notright. If he has to set the target property then he can expect a human readable dialogwhich tells:Launch failed. You are either missing some startup plug-ins (OSGi) for your 3.0workspace or the PDE target preference does not point to the correct location.However, up to now I thought that PDE could detect what's my workspace versionand also what's at the target location - but maybe that's not true. If you knowthis information then you could include this information in the warning dialog. >I have a self containing workspace and cannot launch.As I said before, this is not quite true.  If you also had startup.jar in your workspace, then you would have a self-containing workspace.You can't expect to run against the 3.0 startup.jar and not play by its rule.  The fact of the matter is that being aware of the target platform is a requirement for any developer using Eclipse, if you are not going to have all your plug-ins in your workspace including the one supplying the startup.jar.>If he has to set the target property then he can expect a human readable >dialog which tells...A tad harsh...Aborting the launch and telling you exactly what plug-ins you are missing from your configuration seems pretty reasonable.>PDE could detect what's my workspace version and also what's at the target >location we can determine if your target platform is OSGi-based or not, and that is how we determine if we should do things in legacy mode or OSGi mode, since this is the platform against which you are supposedly developing your plug-ins.What versions of plug-ins you are working on in your workspace is irrelevant and not taken into account. Your workspace plug-ins can have version 6.0 on them, for all we know (much like WSADIE).Bottom line is that PDE does a lot magic behind the scenes and hides as many details as possible from the user, but at the very least one should be aware of a target platform is, as it is the foundation of our self-hosting story.It does not seem to be too much to ask. So you say I simply need to import the startup.jar in into the startup plug-inwhich currently only holds the source and it works, right? Yes, that is what I am claiming.  If you have the plug-in org.eclipse.platform in your workspace containing the startup.jar (in JAR or source form), you would run just fine. actually, maybe it won't work.  But it should and hence we'll keep this bug report open ;-) <Pyinson Data Over Head> The existing configs can't be opened anymore and I cannot add new ones :-(I could no longer add or delete any PDE launch config - even after deleting theJAR again. Only changing the target preference to 2.1.2 fixed the problem again. I knew something crazy like that might happen, but I guess comment #25 did not deter you from trying it <g>I realized there is another problem.  The application that we launch is the one specified in the install.ini in your target platform.  So I believe we are finding org.eclipse.ui.ide.workbench, while the one you want is the old org.eclipse.ui.workbench.In any event, please target 2.1.2 for now (i.e. the way God intended people to self-host :-), and I will come up with a solution for a setup like yours. Thanks, God ;-) Fixed.The problem that Dani reported in comment #26 is due to us counting on an ""install.ini"" file to be there, when it wasn't.People should now be able to self-host without setting the target platform only if they have appropriate startup.jar imported into org.eclipse.platform in their workspace.Dani, keep in mind, that, although this is now possible, it goes not only against the self-hosting rules of engagement, but also against the laws of man and nature :-) "	2011-05-20 22:01:35	1305940000.0	resolved fixed	0eb38b8	1332250000.0	modules/jdbc-pool/src/main/java/org/apache/tomcat/jdbc/pool/interceptor/SlowQueryReport.java

This is actually a problem in the debug framework.Test case:Run a program that produces console outputMaximize a Java EditorClick on the Run button to relaunch the last programNo console is shown no matter the preference.IWorkbenchPage will not bring a part to the top if the page is zoomed.The behavior that is supported is to show the console if it is a fast viewI think that this should be part of the javadoc. Not a problem in the debug framework.Likely just a tweak to the IWorkbenchPage javadoc. Eric is this still an issue with your changes in 3.3? Just tried this and it always seems to work for me.

52772	Tasks View gets corrupted clicking on column header	"I had a Java project with 5-10 classes in it, and about 8-10 //TODO: comments sprinkled throughout.  When I clicked the Resource column of the Tasks view to sort by that attribute, all data in the view disappeared.  The Tasks panel itself, including the control widgets/icons in its title bar are still there.  It just appears as if none of the files in my projects contains any //TODO: comments, which as I stated, is not the case.Most disturbingly, exiting and restarting Eclipse does not resolve the problem.  In fact, I get a message upon startup, apparently as Eclipse is trying to reload the workspace settings which were saved upon the previous exit.Once started up, Eclipse gives me the same error every time I click on any column header of the Tasks view. The error is:ERROR: Searching for markers in Tasks view: An internal error occurred during: ""Searching for markers in Tasks view"". I'm using Eclipse 3.0M7. Found a workaround for this bug, in 2 parts.To clear up the corruption:1. Bring up the Filters dialog   a. From the Tasks view...   b. ...click the Filters icon, or    c. ...select Filters from the drop-down arrow icon2. Toggle the ""Java Task"" checkbox (I'm assuming it's checked already, you want it unchecked).3. Click OK to save and dismiss the dialogTo redisplay your tasks:Repeat steps 1-3 above, but in step 2, you want the ""Java Task"" box to be checked. Downgrading severity since there is now a workaround for the ""corruption"" -- but unless people know about the workaround, I'd say it's at least NORMAL severity. I cannot reproduce the bug at will since following my own workaround, so I'll mark this to resolve later.

52669	[DetachedView] Undocked/floating windows looses position	"When I undock my package explorer in one perspective onto screen/monitor 1 and places it at a specific position. I then switch to debug perspective and then back again, the unlocked/floating window is placed in the exact same position as I left it in.  If I place the floating window in screen/monitor 2 however, the window appears to the far left on screen 1 (possible in position 0,0). This means everytime I switch to and from the debug perspective, I have to move my package explorer undocked window back onto the second screen.  Expected result: The floating/undocked window keeps its position when switching perspectives even if it was positioned on screen 2 as it does on screen 1.  I Have only tested this on Linux Redhat 9.0/KDE3.2 using SWT GTK. Except not using this feature, I don't see a simple workaround to keep the window positions. Which build are you using? This doesn't seem to occur on Windows XP. I've tried this on I200402190800, M7,and the code in HEAD on Feb 23, 2004, and cannot reproduce it.I just checked CVS, and it looks like there was a code change on Jan 30 thatmight have affected the initial window position. If your build is older than Jan30, it's possible that this has been fixed already.In the meantime, I'll try to find a multimonitor GTK setup to test this on. I currently running N20040222 (from Saturday). I first saw the issue (well first time I tried as well) at the first integration build after M7.If there is any debug information I can turn on to help let me know. Okay, hopefully I'll have access to a multimonitor GTK system tomorrow. :-) I am the aforementioned GTK box, but I'm getting the feeling that we have different set-ups.  I'm using nVidia's TwinView functionality which quietly maps two monitors into one large virtual monitor.  Are you using a dual monitor server layout?  Can you please attach your XF86Config so we can try to duplicate?  Thanks.  (As a note, using TwinView, this bug is not reproducible on my box.)

Hmm... it appears that this is due to a difference in the behavior of SWT onparticular GTK setups.BTW, the likely cause is this: when Eclipse creates a detached window, it checksif the window is within the bounds of the Display and moves the detached windowback to the monitor containing the main Eclipse window if it doesn't lieanywhere in the display. It is possible that on GTK, SWT is returning a client region for the Displaythat does not cover all the monitors. I'm not sure if this is a bug or whetherwe're misusing Display.getClientArea. Reassigning to SWT for comment. Chrix can you comment? It's possibly a bug in Display.getClientArea().  In a multi-monitor situation, it should return the same as Display.getBounds().  You should be using Monitor API to play ""shell positioning"" games. Re comment 9: Steve is right. We should really begin by checking if the detachedview interects the client area of any monitor rather than the client area of thedisplay. If this bug was being caused by having a display area that did notencompass all the monitors, this should fix it. I've submitted a patch that implements comment 10. However, if this fixes theproblem then it means that there was definitely a monitor whose client area wasoutside the range of Display.getClientArea(). Stefan, this doesn't seem like an SWT problem.  Can you confirm this?  If not, please close this problem report or take ownership.  Thanks. If the patch mentioned in comment 11 is in the head and made M8, it did not do anything.  If any debug information can be put in and you need my help, please don't hestitate to ask :)  Unfortunatly this is one of two bugs (bug 53814 is the other) that renders detached views totally useless for me. Views also doesn't render its content when switching from one perspective to another when they are detached (I have to reattach and unattach again to get the view content back).   Reassigning to Stefan Adding the helpwanted tag. Nobody on the UI team can reproduce this on ourhardware. Hopefully, someone from the community can step up to the challenge.For anyone who can reproduce this: I believe thatorg.eclipse.ui.internal.DetachedWindow.getConstrainedShellBounds(...) may be agood place to start looking. I was looking in the area Stefan suggested..   It seems my setup is reporting just one monitor:  Monitor org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Monitor@0 area Rectangle {0, 0, 3200, 1200}  DetachedWindow.getConstrainedShellBounds seems to be correct. It says its within the monitor and just pases the bounds through. If the window is on the left monitor, the bounds are set with an X value of less than 1600; right monitor higher than 1600... But the window always ends up on the monitor that the main Eclipse window is on.  I still think this is a SWT/GTK level bug and not platform. I will research more, but if any of you guys that knows this better than me can give me any more pointers.. that would be great :) ..   Can you post the output of 'xdpyinfo -ext all' on your machine? <Pyinson Data Over Head> <Pyinson Data Over Head> I dug deeper into this. I'm guessing the binary part of GTK or GTK itself is doing this to me. Following the pointers from Stefan I followed the shell and opening it. The bounds are set correctly into the shell, but at shell.open(), the bounds change automatically! Steping through Shell.open(), this is the result:  From Shell.java:   public void open () { 	checkWidget ();     // After call: Bounds are { 400,200,100,100 } 	setVisible (true);  // After call: Bounds are { 400,200,100,100 } but shows at { 2000,200,100,100 } 	bringToTop (false); // After call: !!! Bounds change to { 2000,200,100,100 } !!! 	if (!restoreFocus () && !traverseGroup (true)) setFocus (); }  This must be using the position of the parent shell somehow, because if I have eclipse on screen 1, the dialogs always open on screen 1 (and open() adds 1600 to the x coordinate of the dialog if needed), if eclipse is on screen 0, it opens on screen 0.   Now I did manage to do shell.setBounds(2000,200,100,100) after open() and it repositioned to the correct screen. So I am guessing somewhere within setVisible(), it, on linux/gtk, checks the bounds of the parent shells screen and positions it within it? Or maybe gtk itself does this check I don't know..     Wow.  I'm really sorry, but I probably should have realized this sooner.  KDE tries to centre dialogs over the parent shell.  Since we are currently creating our detached views with parents, it will try to centre detached views over the workbench window.  Would this accurately describe what you're seeing?  Yes, playing a little more its not really monitor related. I make my eclipse window really small (normally its always maximized on one monitor) and it will even loose position within the same monitor now, placing it, as you said, centered over the eclipse window.  And yes, I am using KDE as desktop/window manager, so this would explain it.   Is this something I can change (if you know) in my kde configuration or does it have to be a code change from Eclipse to make this solved?  As far as I know, this has to be fixed in Eclipse.  Changing the summary, as this applies to all configurations.  Basically, Eclipse just needs to change one line....  I believe there were reasons why this wasn't feasible, even though it really hurts the usability of detached views on Linux.    Is this issue still being investigated?Douglas, can you specify the one line Eclipse has to change, so that we could dosome testing?Morten, did you find a workaround?I'm a bit frustrated, having bought just yesterday an additional LCD monitorjust for eclipse... I assume that the one line fix Doug is referring to would be setting the parentpointer for the detached window's Shell to null.On windows (and probably other platforms), this will allow the detached windowto end up behind the main workbench window with no way to bring it in front --and this is much more severe than losing the window's position, which is veryannoying but still usable.Since Eclipse is giving the correct window location to the OS, it sounds likethe best we could do is report this bug to GTK and wait for them to fix it.We could also try hacks like ""if OS == GTK, then wait 10ms after opening thewindow and then try to move it again""... but that's really ugly. Does anyoneknow if this has already been reported to the GTK developers? If so, it would beuseful to attach a link here so that we can follow its progress. Or you could make line 51 of DetachedWindow (org.eclipse.ui.workbench)          super((""gtk"".equals(SWT.getPlatform())) ? null : workbenchPage.getWorkbenchWindow().getShell());  A better fix would be possible if SWT provided window manager detection.  To be clear, this bug is KDE specific.  Guillaume, are you using KDE?  If not,please open a new bug.The policy in KDE is to open dialogs always in the center of their parentwindow.  There are two open KDE bugs which relate to this:  1: http://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=78082     - This complains about KDE's policy, and it may be changed in the future.  2: http://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=59572     - If a dialog is hidden and re-shown, KDE acts as if it is a new window       and re-centers it again.  This may also be affecting us here.If either of these were changed I think we would benefit.  There's anothersolution: detached views aren't really ""dialogs"".  Modern window managers have amore expressive notion of window types, and so arguably we should be settingdetached views as ""utility windows"", which would have the nice side-effect ofmaking KDE not enforce its dialog policy on them.  However, this would requirenew API from SWT. Billy, I agree with the idea of using window types -- this would let us describewhat we want in a high level, and SWT could give us the correctplatform-specific behavior. I'm not sure if we'd even need new API -- SWT.TOOL |SWT.NO_TRIM seems to describe what we want, even though it doesn't currentlyhave the desired behavior. I'm sure it can be fixed with some elaborate SWT fix, but wouldn't the fix I suggest under work as well. I know its hacky, but it fixes the Linux/KDE issue. After I put it in, the location is remembered perfectly. Just in case I guess there could be a ""only if gtk"" check in there as well..   Only thing it does is to check whether open() changes the set bounds and then redo it if it happens.  DetachedWindow.java:  /*       * Fixes a problem with Linux GTK when KDE is used as window manager.      * It repositions the detached window to center on top of the parent       * application window.      *  	 * @see org.eclipse.jface.window.Window#open() 	 */ 	public int open() { 		 		if (getShell() == null) 			create(); 		 		Rectangle bounds = getShell().getBounds(); 		int ret = super.open(); 		 		if (!bounds.equals(getShell().getBounds())) { 			getShell().setBounds(bounds); 		} 		 		return ret; 	}  Morten's patch looks good as a short-term fix. I think Billy has the right ideafor the long-term solution.I have committed Morten's patch to HEAD (without modification) and filed bug79462 and bug 79461 requesting SWT support for Billy's suggestions.Thanks for the help, Morten. Since I can't reproduce this I'd be grateful if youcould add a note here once you see this fixed in a build.

What side of the compare editor did you try and delete stuff from? I have M7 andcan't dupe this. Left side.  I didn't notice it in M7 either.  Try the I build. I've noticed a few other places in the I build from Tuesday where the delete key doesn't work. For example, I can't delete a breakpoint from he Breakpoints view. Could this be a more general problem? This is caused by the binding of ""DEL"" in the default key binding set.  I  think I'm going to have to reconsider this.   This is a problem with some work that I've done.  I've removed the ""DEL"" binding from all key configurations.  Markus pointed out something that I hadn't found before.  The reason I was having problems getting this to work properly was that ""org.eclipse.ui.edit.delete"" wasn't registered as a global handler.  I have bound ""org.eclipse.ui.edit.delete"" to ""DEL"" in the default key configuration, added ""DEL"" as a special key (i.e., the widget with focus gets it first), and registered ""org.eclipse.ui.delete"" as global handler.

52444	OSGI os alias returned instead of name.	"org.osgi.framework.BundleContext.getProperty( org.osgi.framework.Constants.FRAMEWORK_OS_NAME )should return canonical OS name rather than alias.So on Windows XP it should return ""WindowsXP"" rather than ""Windows XP"".Am using M7 btw. According to the OSGi R3 spec, the value for org.osgi.framework.Constants.FRAMEWORK_OS_NAME is not specifically specified to be the canonical OS name.  The value of ""Windows XP"" conforms to the OSGi R3 spec. The spec says this should be the canonical name and an OSGI framework thatdoesn't use the canonical name is pretty useless.  That is to say that ifthis isn't a canonical name then clients have to use heuristics to determinewhat the OS is. ( e.g. indexOf( ""win"" ) != -1 ).  This slop is no better thanif the client uses Sun's property ""os.name"" directly and therefore the frameworkisn't adding any value.As for where the spec says it should be canonical, section 4.9.3 ( page 77 )ends with ""Frameworks should try to convert these aliases to the canonical OS or  processor name. The bundle developer should use the canonical name in the  Bundle-NativeCode manifest header."" I like the phrase ""pretty useless"" :)Note that the spec has a ""SHOULD"" in it.  That is unfortunate since it leaves it open to OSGi framework developers to decide whether to implement it or not and will lead to these types of discrepancies.With that said I think we are well motivated to implement this ""SHOULD"" clause in the spec because of the issues outlined in this bug.I'm still not sure how this will fix your problem if you want to run on all Windows platforms.  Wont you still need to have indexOf( ""Win"" ) != -1 code to detect that you are on a Windows system? ""Note that the spec has a ""SHOULD"" in it.  That is unfortunate since it leaves it open to OSGi framework developers to decide whether to implement it or not and will lead to these types of discrepancies.""One of the things I have learned after a decade of software dev is that the usage of the word 'should' in specs is most often like the usage found in the sentence 'One should check both directions for oncoming traffic before crossing the street.'  ""Wont you still need to have indexOf( ""Win"" ) != -1 code to detect that you are on a Windows system?""Guess some people don't look both ways before crossing the street. ;)  Firstof all I don't just want to know if it is Windows as there are differencessignificant differences between the various windows operating systems.

John, at the Eclipsecon talk you had a plugin where you could start jobs thatblock the workspace. That would be really helpful for that kind of problems. Isthis plugin available? <Pyinson Data Over Head> Yes, the job examples plugin is very useful for finding and testing things likethis.  It is available at:http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/platform-core-home/plan_concurrency.html Moving to debug for investigation. *** Bug 52441 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** <Pyinson Data Over Head> Also note that removing the JavaCore.run(...) function could re-break bug 34919. We intentionally added the batching to fix this bug.  We will soon provide a JavaCore.run() allowing to specify a scheduling rule, and batching behavior (if rule is null, no locking, but still batching). Great - could you add the related bug number to this bug - i.e. ""depends on""? Thanks. New JDT Core API got added. See bug 51045.Internals of JDT Core no longer lock when updating cp containers/variables, they still do the batching. <Pyinson Data Over Head> <Pyinson Data Over Head> Philippe, I'm not sure what scheduling rule to pass in. I'm just calling JCORE API to update classpaths, but I do not know what resources that may need to change. Can you suggest what rule I should use? No locking is what you should use. We are investigating on our end. It appears that the implementation of our classpath update mechanism (triggered through container update) is still causing some underlying locking.Will acquire. We cannot take less than a lock on the .classpath file. Made the change in HEAD and moving back to JDT UI to see if the Package Explorer can avoid asking the project for its children when it is checked out.Another possiblity would be for the CVS operation to not take a lock on the project during the whole operation. If there is a way to check for locks, then UI could draw each projects individually (with 'pending' for busy projects). This would avoid blocking the entire view while waiting on one project. The Package explorer content provider asks the JavaProject whether it has children to determine whether the ""+"" should be shown for the Java project.This is the calling sequence: 	JavaProject(JavaElement).getChildren() line: 221	JavaProject(Openable).hasChildren() line: 272	PackageExplorerContentProvider.hasChildren(Object)	PackageExplorerPart$6(AbstractTreeViewer).isExpandable(Object)Since we know that Java projects are never empty, i.e., they have a default package or a JRE container, JavaProject should provide a ""cheating"" implementation of hasChildren() (same as is done for class files):  public boolean hasChildren() throws JavaModelException {	if (isOpen()) {		return getChildren().length > 0;	} else {		return true;	}}Notice, that this would be useful optimization in general. moving to JDT Core It the raw classpath is empty, and .files are filtered out (default), then a project will be empty after being expanded. Just to correct myself in comment #17: I meant ""we cannot take less than a lock on the project"". Removing changes. Since the set classpath operation may need to update the .project file, we cannot take less than the workspace lock. >It the raw classpath is empty, and .files are filtered out (default), >then a project will be empty after being expanded.this is correct but the only consequence is that the ""+"" will show up. Once the user presses ""+"" then getChildren() is called and if there are no children then plus disappears.This means the consequence of the cheating hasChildren() implementation is some user frustration in some rare situation. So it is a classical trade-off. Given that the initial problem is really annoying we should consider making this trade-off. Notice, that the JavaModel is doing the same trick for JarPackageFragmentRoots. This is right. We will implement this. I was just observing that technically a project may end up being empty (but scenario is so rare that the optimistic approach is the best take). Made change suggested by Erich. Verified that the ""UI is blocked"" dialog is not opened in the original scenario. <Pyinson Data Over Head> The changes we made so far reduced the chances of the UI blockage, but when we restore the expansion state of a project it can still happen. The last resort is not restore the expansion state, which would make the start-up faster in general. It is tempting... Moving to JDT/UI to investigate ""not restoring the expansion state"" This would not be for M8, but it seems like the root of the problem is the eagerclasspath computation the first time a JavaProject is opened. This means that atheoretically ""read only"" query on the Java model results in acquiring writelocks on the workspace root. The entire stack trace above is triggered by asingle call in JDT UI to IJavaProject.exists().  It feels like clients of theJava model should be able to perform read-only queries such as exists() on themodel without fear of locking (and possible contention).It looks like this is caused by dynamic classpath containers, which causedownstream plug-ins to be loaded in order to obtain dynamic container contents.Would it be possible for JDT core to instead persist dynamic classpath containervalues across sessions (in metadata area), so it does not need to load containerinitializers at the start of each session? This is the approach taken inplatform core with the new dynamic project references.  Platform core persiststhe dynamic references so it does not need to keep asking for them. Clients areresponsible for setting dynamic references only when the values change. For M8 we will not store/restore the expansion state Verified that 200403260800 doesn't restore expansion state. FYI, in today's integration build JavaProject.exists() no longer populates the Java model. Thus it won't try to initialize classpath containers. *** Bug 56300 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** Created attachment 10858stackReading through all the comments here I'm not sure how fixed this problemshould now be, but I hit this several times this morning during testing,whereas I've never seen this before with the exact same steps:- launch a brand new eclipse- open a CVS Repositories view in the main Resource perspective- in this view create a connection to dev.eclipse.org- begin retrieving the following projects from HEAD: org.eclipse.swt,org.eclipse.swt.examples, org.eclipse.swt.tests, org.eclipse.swt.win32- once this begins press the Run in Background button- switch back to the Navigator view- select .classpath_win32 file, right-click -> Copy- select the partially-retrieved org.eclipse.swt project, right-click -> Paste- it will eventually allow you to specify a new name for your pasted file, makeit "".classpath"" (no quotes), OK- change to the java perspective, becomes permanently busymy trace (taken from my self-hosted environment) is attached *** Bug 63281 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** The launching plugin synchronization is causing a deadlock here when initializing installed JREs and the JRE container. Fixed. Changes in JavaRuntime and LaunchingMessages.properties. We (Kevin & I) chose to fix this by performing the preference save (which eventually triggers a job to update the java model) in a job. Thus, the synchronized code in JavaRuntime never enters a job itself (and does not need the workspace lock), as the update is performed asynchrnously, in a job, by a different thread.We verified that we could reproduce the problem as shown in comment#34 without the fix, and the problem did not occurr with the fix.

51408	Remove all infopop plugins	In the interest of having less plugins, and being more like the Eclipse platform, we should remove all our infopop plugins. The infopop .xml files should be inside the user documentation plugins (*.doc.user), as they are user docs. To see examples of this, see the following plugins from the JDT and PDE:org.eclipse.jdt.doc.userorg.eclipse.pde.doc.userNote: We don't have a Doc component in Bugzilla like the platform and JDT.. should we create one? It is not clear at all if unwanted modules/directories can be removed from theCVS.  This requires further investigation. Trace and Log function has already moved the infopop code into the source plugin.Remaining plugins are from the Test tool so please assign the defect to Dominique Qiyan, once the infopop is moved to the source code, you must investigate how to remove these empty modules from CVS. This defect was originally talking about the actual contents of the infopops rather than the CVS directories/modules (it's an old defect). I noticed that the infopops were moved, but not in the user docs plugins (they are instead in source code plugins). Was there a special reason for this?While we're on the subject of removing CVS directories/modules, we might as well include other unused ones, like those two trace fragments for execution and object references. Since infopops are part of PII and dropped with as PII, I would keep them in the source plugin, not docs. Also, infopops are used with by the actual UI, and they only make sense in this context.And you are right, once Qiyan figures out how to remove empty modules, we should remove ALL unused modules.  In CVS, a module can be removed completely if this module has been removed fromall branches.  This is currently not the case for 1.3, i.e., these infopops arestill in use.  Nothing can be done until the modules are removed from 1.3 (andall previous branches).  Or the removal of the module will result in loss ofdata in the CVS. Won't/can't fix.

When I click on ""Open Perspective"" button, I often get only oneperspective to choose from, in addition to ""Other..."". I find thisquite annoying. Makes me move my mouse and click twice.Especially when the dialog that pops up show so few perspectives thatthey easily fit in the original list. I know progressive disclosureand showing me all the options are conflicting design tradeoffs, butI'd suggest to reconsider the use cases. I press ""Other..."" so often,in fact, more often than an offered choice, it makes me wonder. Thisbutton is really a role-switcher. Make it easier to switch roles? Nick,  If this is related to New Look, please reassign.  Sorry. We used to keep an MRU list of recently used perspectives, and add them to the shortcut list for free (up to a total size of 10).  But this didn't scale well, and it went against the intent of allowing perspectives to spell out the valid transitions to/from other perspectives.What we could do, though, is recognize that if a user chooses a different perspective, then that is a valid transition and we should remember it in the shortcut list (for the originating perspective only).There are also cases where the perspective shortcut list does not include the current perspective.  This is just silly since the menu should indicate which of the listed perspectives is the current one.We could also add more shortcuts in the SDK, e.g. have a CVS shortcut in the Java perspective.  Unfortunately, these two don't know about each other so this would have to be added by a 3rd party. Can you give concrete examples of transitions that you're missing? The one I miss most often are the most basic perspectives: Resource and CVS. Couldn't they somehow specific that they want to be added to anyone's choice, regardless who it is? In other words, no matter what is my current perspective, I want a quick way to get to CVS or a resource perspective(none of which are proposed by Java) "	2011-12-18 23:41:25	1324270000.0	resolved fixed	6f3cafe	1324680000.0	java/org/apache/catalina/tribes/transport/bio/util/FastQueue.java

This problem is caused by a recent binding of ""org.eclipse.ui.edit.delete"" to ""Delete"".

52213	[RCP] definition of IProduct and IBundleGroup properties needed	"We need to also agree on the expected property values for things like windowImage, featureImage, *Image, or welcomePageURL. For starters, the comments in org.eclipse.platform/about.ini should be incorporated into the Javadoc specs for these new constants. Created attachment 8361defines two new interfaces to hold the constantsThis patch defines the constants I described in comment#8.  I combined the textfrom about.ini with existing javadoc to describe each constant.  Its still abit vague on the type of each value. Reminder: be sure to tag all new API elements introduced in 3.0 with ""@since 3.0"". For new classes or interfaces, tagging the class or interface is sufficient. Created attachment 8364new patch with @since tags addedchanges from comment#12 Comment on attachment 8361defines two new interfaces to hold the constantsnew patch attached Having the optoin for someone else to contribute branding is intersting.  IProductProvider gives one that ability.  So i don't think we need any additional ability to programatically spec products or product values.  The workbench should be free to fetch these values however they like but keep in mind that we are putting forward this notion of ""product"" and people might use -product etc on the command line.  To then get the branding from somewhere else might be confusing. Regarding IBundleGroup.getName(), is this translated?  I assume so since the bundle group provider is a regular extension and can translate strings.If not, this is a difference from what we had before. I expect it to be translated.   I'm wondering about the content of the url's give in, for example, the IBundleGroupConstants.TIPS_AND_TRICKS_URL property.  Should url given by the application have enough context to identify the bundle that contains the file or will there be enough information elsewhere? Re comment #15, OK, I'll change the Workench to just use IProduct. Created attachment 8410patchThis patch removes the ""_TAG"" portion of the constant names and puts a ""_URL""suffix on constants which expect an URL.  An outstanding issue is to enhancethe javadoc describing the URLs. Re comment #20, we need to know who is responsible for resolving the URL for images, and also for resolving $nl$ variables (e.g. for the welcomePage property).  Is it the bundle group provider or the Workbench?Both of these must be done in the context of the bundle group's primary plugin (plus any fragments), but it does not seem possible to determine the primary plugin from IBundleGroup.  Can we assume that IBundleGroup.getIdentifier() can be used as the id for its primary plugin?  Probably not since the feature story allows it to be different. Previous comment should have read ""Re comment #18"".Note that TIPS_AND_TRICKS_URL has been renamed to TIPS_AND_TRICKS_HREF (same as about.ini) and is already resolved. Patch applied with some minor changes, which I'll go over with Andrew. The url format should be done either as absolute paths or as platform specific urls such asplatform:/base/plugins/some_plugin_id/windowImage.gifin which case you won't have to worry about primary plugin id being different than primary feature id.For example, the update bundle group provider will read the about.ini and return append it to platform:/base/plugins/primary_plugin_id/. Thanks for clarifying, Dorian.  Returning a URL that is result of IPluginDescriptor.find is OK.  Will you also resolve the $nl$ variable and friends?The constant definitions have been released to head in org.eclipse.ui.branding.IProductConstants and IBundleGroupConstants (in the org.eclipse.ui.workbench plugin).  They did not make it into our integration build submission today, however since you're not going to be referencing them directly anyway, I guess it doesn't matter.Can you have a look over these and let us know if anything is unclear?  Please check out what's in head rather than in the patches above. Dorian, please let us know when Update starts providing the values so that we can make progress on bug 54547 (name, appName, windowImage, windowImages needed for M8) and bug 54548 (the remaining IProduct and IBundleGroup values needed for M9).  The former is also blocking us from getting off the runtime compatibility plugin which we want to do for M8.Thanks,Nick Nick, I will try to do it tomorrow so we have it done by next integration build. I figured the simplest implementation is to take the existing AboutInfo class and modify it.As alluded to in an earlier comment, the return values for windowImage/featureImage would be URL's (unless you want String values), and Images must be created by the UI component. The reason is that the code that returns the values runs in non-ui plugins. The getProperty methods on IProduct and IBundleGroup only return Strings, so you'll have to return the (qualified, not partial) URLs in string form.  We'll create the images from those. Mea culpa...Once I started implementing it, I realized getProperty() returns String, not Object. I will probably have something for tonight's build, but I'll let you know. Closing, since the constants have been defined, and Update is now generating them (bug 54574).  Further changes to use IProduct are blocked by bug 54790. This is a reminder/placeholder for work that has been ongoing/pending but I can't find a matching report.Runtime has added IProduct to model the default primary feature and IBundleGroup to model features.  The UI gets various bits of information from the original entities and needs to adapt to the new structures.  After consulting with Nick, both IProduct and IBundleGroup were left open ended and UI ignorant.  Rather they provide a general getProperty() method.  The valid key value pairs are to be defined by the consumers/users of the objects.  So the UI should define the form of the information it needs for the product branding (e.g., windowImage, ...) and the about dialog.I don't know where this should be specified but the update team for example will need to know how to map the about.ini information onto IProducts and similarly, how to populate IBundleGroups. For IProduct, the properties include:- app name (a tag for the SWT Display, used on X systems)- product name    - shown in the window title in the SDK, e.g. ""Eclipse SDK""   - also on some actions (e.g. About)- about text and about image  - shown in the about dialog (which currently is in the IDE layer)- window image  - shown in the top left corner of workbench windowsFor IBundleGroup, we'll have:- image  - shown in the row below the about image in the about dialog- tip and tricks href (IDE layer)- welcome page URL (IDE layer)- welcome perspective id (IDE layer)We have discussed removing dependencies on IProduct and IBundleGroup from the Workbench proper, and obtaining the generic properties (e.g. product name, window image) from the WorkbenchAdvisor (or allowing it to configure these on the IWorkbenchConfigurer).  However, I'm having second thoughts about this now.  We should probably have a single story for how these properties are obtained, common across all RCP apps. Not quite sure what you mean about removing the dependency on IProduct and IBundleGroup.  These interfaces are there exclusively for the UI.  If you are not going to use them then we will delete them.  Not sure how the about dialog will get populated.  Assuming I got it wrong and you are going to use these at some level, teams like update need the exact keys they should have in the getProperty() collection when they produce an IProduct and IBundleGroup.   Need to define constant pools IProductConstants and IBundleGroupConstants in new package org.eclipse.ui.branding, with definitions for the existing properties used from about.ini.Should also define a windowImages property for bug 53172. Re comment #2, the about dialog will be changed to use IProduct and IBundleGroup as soon as we can get the properties we need from here.I assume Dorian is waiting on us for the constant defs.  Dorian, do you know when the change on your side will be made assuming we can get you the defs by Monday?We'll also change to get the product name and icon from IProduct.  But what I was debating here is whether this should be done by the Workbench proper or by the application.  That is, should the Workbench always just go to IProduct for these, or should it be the application's responsibility to configure the Workbench with these (it would be free to use IProduct or set them directly).Jeff, do you see any problem with giving the app flexibility here?  It would allow simple RCP apps to be able to configure the Workbench without requiring a product provider or bundle group provider. Nick, I see a problem with locating constants in org.eclipse.ui.branding, because the IProduct/IBundleGroup implementations are currently in update.configurator which has no ui dependencies.I have no problem moving them up to update.ui, but that is only easy to do for IProduct because it is contributed via an extension, but the IBundleGroup is done via registration and update.ui may not be running when you need it.I am on a course next week, but will be working evenings, and should be able to get this done by the end of the week. I think there needs to be a ""gentleman's agreement"" between UI and Update on these properties.  By putting these in a public UI interface, we are spelling out what the UI expects.  Update and other product/bundleGroup providers will need to supply these, but probably won't have UI as a prerequisite. *handshake* :-)Jeff, currently, there is no relationship between IProduct and IBundleGroup, and while IProduct is contributed as an extension, the IBundleGroup is registered with the platform (so the assumption is that the class that registers had been active before the UI asks for bundle groups).Will this change by end of 3.0 or will it stay as is? The following is my current list of values in the ui's AboutInfo and where I think they can come from in the new scheme.  The sources are a combination of specific methods in the IProduct and IBundleGroup and generic constants accessed through the keys I'm defining now.I wanted to give people a chance to comment on the mappings before I attach the patch.featureId			IBundleGroup.getIdentifierversionId			IBundleGroup.getVersionfeaturePluginLabel	IBundleGroup.getName    - I'm not positive on this one.  Right now this value winds up coming from PluginDescriptor.getLabel, who's comment says ""Returns a displayable label for this plug-in.  Returns the empty string if no label for this plug-in is specified in the plug-in manifest file.  Note that any translation specified in the plug-in manifest file is automatically applied.""  While the comment for IBundleGroup.getName says ""Returns the human-readable name of this bundle group.""

Some people prefer the ""old style"" progress report by text in the status line. The flowating view is unessary and adds unwanted UI clutter. If a user wants to see enhanced or detailed progress indication he can double click on the progress bar icon and the Progress view is opened. That is ok.You might consider changing this from a floating window into a tool tip like yellow bubble that informs the user about new progress but this should only stay visible for a few secondes (like the yellow bubbles used by Windows tray notifications). Currently you can still get the progress view by clicking the maximize button. Likewise clicking the minimize will remove it. That's not what people want. I don't want to see this ugly yellow window when working in Eclipse. There has to be an option to turn it of.IMHO this adds unwanted UI clutter to the workbench. The previouse solution without the extra popup window was preferable fine.Note, a UI has to be as smart as possible. This is not achieved by popping up windows everywhere somebody has something to tell. There is an option to turn it off. You you click the minimize button it will not open again unless you double click on the progress indicator.

51910	two session headers for the same log	"i20040212If something bad happens during startup, that may cause entries to be written tothe log. Since there are situations were the Eclipse Starter may throw anexception to the launcher (org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main), that exception willbe logged as well, causing a new SESSION header to be written to the log. Thatmay cause a lot of confusion. The session header should be written once (obviously) and by the log object itself. That object should remember that it wrote the session info and not do it again.  This may need to be protected from concurrent execution.Note that if logging happens while the log is in the config area and then happens again after the instance area is set, depending on the code (ie. ,if we create a new log object) there may be confusion between the SESSION entry in the copied config log and a SESSION entry written into the instance log. I see cases where the SESSION header is missing some elements, like the date.  This would be impossible from the FrameworkLog implementation.  Also the FrameworkLog implementation is synchronized so it should not be possible to get two SESSIONS written for the same running instance, we do not create a new log instance either when the instance area is set.  Is there some other code that does logging?  maybe from eclipse.exe or are these kinds of logs being written by org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main? My original description was not clear: the framework log will write a sessionheader only once. The problem is that if we end up throwing an exception fromthe EclipseStarter to org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main, that exception will belogged again by Main, which has its own logic for logging (does not rely on theFrameworkLog), and *always* write a session header before logging.This didn't happen in the past because Eclipse Boot/Runtime didn't log anythingduring startup, just threw an exception so Main would do it.Since we don't have as much control of when logging is done (for instance, anyFrameworkEvent.ERRORs will cause log entries to be written), I believe we shouldrethink the role of Main and stop relying on it for logging, maybe by capturingany exceptions in the EclipseStarter and exitting (with System.exit) from therein all cases (we currently exit from there only if everything goes fine). Correction for comment 3 above: where I said, ""that exception will be loggedagain by Main"", please read ""that exception will be logged by Main"". Code released in HEAD.

51872	UI blocked by quickdiff during CVS update	"<Pyinson Data Over Head> Tom, please comment.In my opinion it is OK to get the lock since it is fine grained on a singlefile. It looks as if someone else blocked the whole workspace (or large parts ofit) and then we need to wait otherwise the user continues working on an alreadymodified /deleted document.Michael was there some other job that might have acquired a coarse grained lock? I guess it is ok to obtain a lock (you have to if you need exclusive access andto avoid clashing with someone else). (We don't really need exclusive access -its just that its not possible to get non-blocking access to an IFile).Usually, LastSaveReferenceProvider.readDocument is called from the line differinside a background job - but not in the described case upon content changes.Perhaps we could schedule an extra job in this case and push it into thebackground. The document line differ can handle updates to the referencedocument in any thread. We might argue that it is OK to go on with an outdated quick diff in such a casebut e.g. in case of a pessimistic team provider this will not help much: as soonas the user starts typing, validateEdit will request a lock and will then beblocked by the coarse grained lock.So instead of tweaking here the ""other"" (whatever) job should reconsiderblocking the whole workspace or large parts of it. When peforming a CVS update, the smallest granularity we can get is the project (this is a CVS restriction). In this case, we grab multiple projects (i.e. those involved in the update) and we will definitely consider reducing this to one project at a time. However, that is the smallest we could go and even at the granularity, this problem could still occur (i.e. a single project with a large number of changes).However, this is just one case of a background job with a large granularity. There will be others, I am sure and to expect all tools built on top of Eclipse to be good citizens in this area is not a realistic expectation in my opinion. The problem with this particular case is that the work being done by quick diff is an indirect result of another operation. When the blockage occurs, the user can see the background jobs (i.e. update) but has no idea what the forground operation is and whether they should cancel it. I got the traceback by cancelling it. I don't even know if this left things in an OK state or not. Here's what I think needs to be done (for what it is worth):1) CVS reduces granularity as much as possible (entered new bug 51883).2) QuickDiff needs to either...- not obtain a scheduling rule in the UI thread since it may be triggered indirectly by another operation - or it should somehow be made appearent in the blockage dialog what the blocked operation is so the user knows what's going on (unfortunately there is no way I know of to do this at the current time). If the later is chosen, the QuickDiff operation must be able to recover from the cancellation in some way that is reasonable (since the user has the option of cancelling it). Michael, - the reference provider needs the lock when executing inside a job (see bug44667). There are two possible solutions on our side:1) we could push the operation into the background job, so the ui thread cannotbe blocked. Dani, this does not result in a outdated quick diff since theDocumentLineDiffer can handle delayed / unsynched updates to the reference document.2) (perhaps: only acquire the lock if we are called from outside the ui thread.this is unsafe, since a background job that is trying to, say, delete the filewill run into an exception.)-> I favor 1)Dani, of course there will still be a problem in the interactive case youmention in comment 3 - but only if the user starts editing, which is far lesslikely than having a document open in an editor that is being updated. We shouldonly block where we really need, which is not the case here. fixed > 20040216- updating triggered by IElementStateListener methods are now pushed into a Job,so that the UI thread will never have to wait. SeeLastSaveReferenceProvider#ReadJob.- locking up the ui thread is still possible if the read job was started andlater the ui thread tries to acquire the lock on the resource. However, in thenormal case, the background job will just be blocked, which is fine.

51887	Feature request: Allow more control over Debug view	"Investigate for 3.0 Deferred consider in 3.1 Created attachment 16743Patch on top of 3.0.1 to add ""selection change"" and ""double-click to open editor"" preferences for Debug view.I also ran into the same problem (multi-core debugging), but went aboutimplementing a different solution.  Namely I first added an option to have theuser double-click on a stack frame in order to open the editor, instead of justselecting it.  Unfortunately it turned out to be a pretty complicated change,because I still wanted the IP to be painted if the editor was already openedand visible.  So I separated out the painting of the IP and the positioning ofthe editor in Debug view and related interfaces.This still didn't solve all my problems and I added a second option: not tochange the selection in Debug view when a target event occurs.	This was a muchsimpler change.The option for turning off automatic selection change is much more important tome, because it directly fixes the multi-core debugging problem, but I thinkboth changes are valuable.  Also separating the IP pointing from editorpositioning fixes a bug where if the editor for selected stack frame is closedand re-opened, the IP is missing. Created attachment 16926Regenerated the patch in universal diff format (still on top of 3.0.1 label). Filed seperate bug for disappearing instruction pointer: bug 86196. Rather than a preference, I propose that we just implement the debug view to *not* auto-select threads/frames that suspend when a suspended thread/frame is already selected.I'd rather avoid the double-click to show source option. Your suggestion (setting focus only if not stack frame is currently selected)would go a long way, but it wouldn't solve the problem completely.  In ourdebugger a breakpoint can be configured to resume the process after a shorttime-period.  While, this feature is most useful for demos, some user casesinvolving profilers can also be imagined.In this scenario, the debugger constantly suspends and resumes effectivelytaking  over the entire IDE.  You cannot edit another file, without anothereditor being thrown up on top of it constantly.I suppose the workaround would be to switch to a perspective without the Debugview, but that's not ideal.BTW.  I agree, after much longer consideration, the double-click feature is notneeded at all. Q: If the breakpoint is intended to be ""quiet"" or ""invisible"" to the user (i.e. suspend so a tool can gain information), shouldn't the breakpoint be implemented as such, in that debug model? For example, the Java debugger supports ""invisible"" breakpoints - you can create breakpoints that are not registered with the manager, so the user does not see them. Then, when one of the breakpoints is hit, we use the IJavaBreakpointListener mechanism to notify listeners, and allow the listeners to decide/vote on whether a full blown suspend should in fact occurr. This allows tools to perform some function when a breakpoint is hit, without the user ever knowning about it. Like I said, the feature is most useful for doing demos, in which the debuggeris shown hitting a breakpiont and resuming while the person doing the demodescribes what is going on.  So the breakpoint is actually intended to work likea normal breakpoint and not be hidden.There is also another use case for which I originally started investigating thisoption:In our debugger the user has an option to open a command-line interface view tointeract with the debugger at a very low level.  In this case the user can typein commands to read/write memory, registers, etc.  Some of these commands have aside effect of stopping the process that the user is debugging.  When thishappens, the focus is switched out of the command-line view and into the editor,which apparently drives users crazy.Maybe it would be enough to provide a programmatic interface to temporarilydisable the switching of the focus.  We could do this when the user switchesfocus into the command-line interface, and re-enabled it when he leaves. There is a user preference to control activation of the workbench when a breakpoint is hit - IDebugUIConstants.PREF_ACTIVATE_WORKBENCH. You can experiment with setting this pref programatically. Note, if the command line interface view is an Eclipse view, focus should remain in the view. The debugger opens an editor without changing the focus. I went back and checked, and you are absolutely correct, the editor being openeddoes not change the focus.  But what it does do is un-maximize whatever thecurrent view is.  Since the users normally work with the command-line window (which is an eclipseview) in maximized mode the side effect of the window being unmaximized is justas problematic.  If there was a way to open an editor window without un-maximizing the currentview, than I think my problem would be pretty much solved (as thecontinue-on-break feature is really not critical).  Do you think that this is a org.eclipse.workbench.ui bug?  The command that isresponsible for this behavior is IWorkbenchPage.openEditor(IEditorInput input,String editorId, boolean activate).  Since activate==false, then it shouldreally not affect the currently-maximized view. See realted bug 12905. It looks like the problem of un-maximizing is back. However, this is a workbench bug. A new bug should be opened against the workbench for this. This bug should remain in debug to address the selection issue. changed LaunchViewEventHandler to only select when there is no selection Darin, please verify reopening. Change breaks selection after drop to frame (nothing is selected) fixed. Darin, please verify Verified. It would be nice to exert more control over the Debug view.  For example, the debugger I am writing is a multi-core debugger.  Multiple breakpoints can be hit simultaneously.  The default behavior of the Debug view is to select a new Stack Frame when a breakpoint is hit, open up the source code, and position it at this line.  This is very confusing in the multi-core environment.  I may be stepping through code when another breakpoint is hit, and suddenly I am staring at a completely different file.The control I would like to exert over the debug view would include:1) Control whether or not selection occurs.2) Control whether or not tree expansion/contraction occurs.

51860	TrimLayout margins inconsistent with other layouts	Trimlayout has a margin width and height of 0 initially.This is inconsistant with other layout classes currently existing.While this is a non-typical layout and likely not going to be used outside the workbench, but it might.  And I think it is better to be consistant in these cases than different.  It will likely just cause frustration for anyone new to this layout. This is inconsistent with default SWT layouts, but is consistent with defaultJFace layouts (which either use 0 or dialog units for their margin sizes). Ibelieve the JFace convention is more relevant here, but perhaps we should deferthis issue until when (and if) this class becomes API. If it becomes part ofSWT, we should follow the SWT convention (hardcoded margins in pixels). If itbecomes part of JFace, we should follow the JFace convention (0-size margins orsizes in dialog units).Is this satisfactory? OK, I will agree to JFace being consistent with itself and different than SWT. In that case, flagging as invalid.

51852	"[Progress] ""Pending"" TreeItem causes unexpected shifting (usability)"	"When population of children treeitems is done using a background job, a ""Pending"" TreeItem is places as child 0 of the container treeitem.  When the job completes, this treeitem is disposed.  So, when the user places the mouse over an item and tries to select it, the item often moves up one position because of the above disposal.To avoid the sifting, the ""Pending"" item could be the last child instead of the first, since that is where the pending children show up.  Or, the parent treeitem could be decorated in its string to show something like:""cdt-home (pending)"" Sorry for the typos.  should say ""placed"" and ""shifting"".And the point is that the user ends up selecting the treeitem below the intended selection. I've always prefered decorating the parent instead of using the pending childnode. That way if the node is somehow collapsed, you can still understand thatit's fetching child nodes.

51580	[RCP][Views] Need the ability to resize views programmatically	"We need the ability to resize any view in a perspective programmatically. Consider for M8.  Could you describe the use cases you need to address? Here are some current use cases for this feature.  This function should probably be mediated by the primary application, perspective or layout.Preview Pane Use Case:In some applications a view is used as a ""Preview Pane"".  This view needs to snap open and closed.  The closed state would be the view sized as small as possible, such that just the titlebar is showing.  The open state would be sized programmatically or would reflect some previous state.Preferred Size Use Case:In some applications there may be a view that can only format it's contents properly at specific size intervals.  When a user sizes a view to a size that the view cannot support, the view should snap it's size to the closest supported interval. Reassigning to you Matt since you're doing the work on this. Created attachment 8564A patch that provides support for this featureHere it is.  I'm okay with changing the new method name and params.  Let meknow if you don't like the inner class or the recursion.Test case will follow.-m@ Created attachment 8565Test case for the patchTest case for the patch. This is critical for Lotus/LWP. I'm looking at the patch now.It would be better if it applied to IWorkbenchParts in general, not justIViewParts (I know you're not using editors, but still <g>).Also, using your test case, it seems to have no effect when the view is zoomed.Not sure what the expected behaviour is here.  I wouldn't expect it to unzoom,or change the zoomed size, but perhaps it could adjust the size of its unzoomedstate. Stefan, would you also be able to review this patch (since you implementedcollapse and know this area better than me)? I've released the internal part of this to allow you to get by for M8.I'm not yet comfortable with the API or behaviour, so this will need to getaddressed later, either for M9 or post-3.0. I agree with the editor comment, but don't have the time to implement.  Are you suggesting resizing the whole editor area?About zoom and unzoom.  We don't have expectations there, we aren't zooming anything but LWPEditors (which are actually views).-m@ Marking for revisiting in M9 as per comment #9. I'm don't think we should add this enhancement. The preview pane use case couldbe handled by providing API to minimize a view.However, the preferred size use case is problematic. If views are using resizelisteners to override their size, this will cause all sorts of problems:1. If there are two such views sharing a sash, it will either cause infiniterecursion or violate one of their preferred sizes.2. This effectively works by setting an incorrect size on the view, thencorrecting it, which will cause flicker and drastically slow down the layoutalgorithm (the runtime will be multiplied by the number of views with preferredsizes).3. Sash resizing has no knowledge of the view's preferred sizes, so there is noway to give the user feedback as they drag the sash... the sash will simply moveto a different location than where they dropped it, which will be unexpected.If we really need to handle this use case, we should allow the view to describeits preferred sizes and leave it up to the layout algorithm to try to resolvethe conflicts. I agree with everything you say BUT the feature is there in the form of Workbench internals.  We are in a code freeze state and will be picking up integration builds between now and M9.  Please do not remove this feature as we do not have the cycles to refactor.  -m@ No further changes planned here for 3.0.We'll leave the internal method in, and working, but cannot commit to it being API.Need to address the following limitations post 3.0:- handle editors- address conflicting constraints between parts in the same layout Note: I'm working on a fix for this in bug 53649. Currently, the plan is this:Each IWorkbenchPart will be able to implement a computeMaximumSize(intavailableWidth, int availableHeight) method that returns the preferred maximumsize for the part, given the available space. Parts that want quantized sizes or a snapped closed size will return thenext-smallest quantized size in their computeMaximumSize method. Normal partswill simply return the available width/height as their maximum height. Theworkbench will use these methods to compute a layout with minimal conflicts (ifthere are no conflicts, everything will end up at its preferred size).There will also be API to notify the workbench that the preferred size of somepart has changed and that it should trigger a layout at the next opportunity.Combined, these will offer the main functionality of programmatic resizing butwithout the dangers.bug 53649 will contain the changes to the workbench layout algorithm. The APIchanges will be added here. Sorry, nothing further planned here for 3.1. Reassigning bugs in component areas that are changing ownership. Reading all this, I ask the question: Is it currently possible to adjust the size of a view programmatically? My use case: I want to have standalone view at the bottom of my workbench. When I click a button it will expand/contract the view's height. I want all the neighbouring views to resize as this view increases or decreases in size.  This seems to be just as applicable to other OSs and not just to V3.0 -- can someone update the OS to all and the version to 3.3M3? (In reply to comment #18)> Reading all this, I ask the question: Is it currently possible to adjust the> size of a view programmatically? No, not without using internals.  I haven't checked, but looking at the last comment on bug 53649 it also seems that the implementation part of this has some problems.As with most other bugs, I'd be happy to look at a patch for this.  Matt, do you still use internals, or did you find another way to address your use cases? The patch will be welcomed as long as it will not introduce bugs or become incompatible with future releases. If it could meet these requirements then it could just as well be implemented in the platform? Sorry if I didn't make myself clear:  I have marked this bug as helpwanted because I cannot promise anything for 3.3.  If this is important enough for someone in the community that they are willing to spend some time on this, I can give feedback on what they think the API should be, and if we can reach agreement, this will be put into the Platform. I'll be willing to make the necessary changes, since it will be important for our project. Can you please direct me to the classes that you think I would have to modify in order to make this work. What would be the deadline for the 3.3 release? We are no longer using this internal method.  Stephan says this is fixed by bug#53649 with new API.  See comment#15.  Has anyone tried using these new APIs? There is no new API (yet).  This bug is about defining an API for the implementation added by the fix for bug 53649.  It seems that ISizeProvider is the place to start exploring what Stefan did.  Stefan, do you know if there are any examples how this can be used?Note that we wouldn't want to open up the workbench layout (view sizes etc.) to anybody.  Only the application should be able to do this.  New API should be put into WorkbenchWindowAdvisor/Configurer if it is independent of the current presentation.  I wouldn't be surprised if this has to be tied to a presentation, in which case I am not sure where that new API belongs.  Perhaps one could define an API at the WorkbenchWindowAdvisor/Configurer which is (optionally) implemented by a presentation and being used by the application. Actually, I think that regular workbench parts should be able to express a desire to be resized to match some new preferred size, without having to resort to controlling this from the advisor.  E.g. imagine I added a ""preview pane"" view after-the-fact to a mail application.The advisor could still control whether requests for resize are honoured though. I agree this behaviour (comment #26) will make more sense.  (In reply to comment #27)> I agree this behaviour (comment #26) will make more sense. In the end, yes, but until we have a good understanding of the use cases for this, I would prefer to start small and just add API to the advisor.  Your particular advisor implementation can then have API that is being called by your views when they want to request a resize. If I recall correctly, most of the hard stuff is in place. The presentation stacks can already express a preference for their size by implementing ISizeProvider and the workbench will resolve any conflicts and size them appropriately. They can also indicate that their preferred size has changed, which will cause them to be resized.All that's missing is some way for the views and editors themselves to participate in this. It's relatively easy to let views implement ISizeProvider and expose this to the presentation via the IPresentablePart. They'd need a new method on the site that lets them tell the workbench about changes in their preferences.However, I hesitated in hooking up the remaining bits since I couldn't think of a good way to actually implement a presentation that handled stacks of views nicely:1. What should we do if the views in the stack had conflicting preferred sizes?2. What should we do if the views have size preferences but haven't yet been lazily materialized?I definitely don't like the idea of making the stack change size when the active part changes, but I never really thought of another satisfactory solution.Of course, none of these problems occur with standalone views. If the people who want this feature are planning on using standalone views and custom presentations, it should be easy to satisfy them. The default Eclipse presentation, however... To add another use case for this feature, I have a requirement to implement the ability to arrange views programmatically.  The user can size them however they want, but in cases where there are many views often this is a hassle to get them set up in a particular way.  For example, say there are 4 of the same view stacked in a set with one view in the foreground.  The user should be able to choose to arrange these in a 2x2 grid with each view taking up one quarter of the size of the original.  This is particularly useful when the views contain similar contents, such as scientific images that vary only very slightly and being able to see several images side by side is crucial to the application's functionality.The same logic would stand for editors, but in my particular case I am using views.Feel free to contact me if you need any further clarification or details. Currently, I am very pessimistic whether I (or anyone else on the Platform/UI team) will have the time to actively pursue a solution for this in time for 3.3.  I agree that this is important for RCP apps, but there are so many other important things to work on at the same time.Craig, are you still willing to contribute a patch?Note that since this affects API, it will have to go in before the API freeze, which is about mid-February. I would rather wait for this feature to be done properly by the Platform/UI team. Is it possible to schedule it for 3.4? If this is possible, would it also be possible to give us a quick summary of the API (for this feature), during your design process. So we can give our comments. The code should be relatively easy to write. The question is: how do we handle stacks? I think it's reasonable to support this feature for stand-alone views only. This needs to apply to stacks as well, not just to standalone views.  To give the ability to programmatically move a view in and out of a stack would be required for the use case I outlined above where we need to be able to take all views in a stack and arrange them as non-stacked, with each view being given a fraction of the real estate that the stack previously occupied. Another use case: I have a standalone view containing a ""command line"" for my programming language. I want the height of the view to be fixed (it only contains a single-line Text widget), but the width can be allowed to vary.I see two possible solutions:1. Have an IPageLayout.addStandaloneView that could take some additional parameters such as minWidth, maxWidth, minHeight, maxHeight (with SWT.DEFAULT if you didn't want a constraint). The only problem with that approach is that you might want to compute your minimum height (say in my case) by the actual height of the contents, and it would be too early to compute since you would not have created the contents.2. Allow ViewPart to implement ISizeProvider (see comment#29). Perhaps it could only be honored for standalone views? (In reply to comment #36)> 2. Allow ViewPart to implement ISizeProvider (see comment#29). Perhaps it could> only be honored for standalone views?This is an interesting idea.  Does anyone care to implement this prototypically and report back on this bug how well it works? Created attachment 59221Patch that implements this enhancementHere's a work-in-progress patch that implements the feature. It does the following:1. Adds new API. - Workbench parts can now implement ISizeProvider as a mix-in interface.- There is a new property, IWorkbenchPartConstants.PROP_PREFERRED_SIZE, that parts can fire when their preferred size changes. This will trigger a layout in the workbench.- IPresentablePart now implements ISizeProvider and gets a new property ID, so the presentation can access the preferred sizes of the parts.IMHO, the API spec is relatively clean.2. Updates the default presentation to make use of the new API part's preferred size. This is intended mainly as an example for Boris rather than release-quality code. If there is only one part in a stack, the stack uses the constraints from that part. If there is more than one part in the stack, constraints are disabled for that stack. This logic seems reasonable, but currently the constraints from the part are used verbatim. If this were to be released, the constraints would need to be adjusted to take into account space for the tabs, border, toolbar, etc. Either way, I assume that Boris would want to make his own decisions about the logic for the default presentation so I didn't polish this bit too much.This patch should be enough to experiment with views and presentations that use constraints. I'll attach an example view-with-constraints soon.Todo:- This patch isn't well tested. It should be VERY well tested before it goes in.  It's really easy to make the workbench unusable if we get this wrong.- I'm not checking for runtime exceptions when calling client-implemented ISizeProvider methods. This should be fixed, and constraints should be disabled for any part that ever throws an exception.- I've been able to easily create constraints that cause stacks to disappear entirely. This is either a sign that the default presentation isn't protecting against dumb constraints in its parts or that the workbench layout itself has some yet-undiscovered bugs. Probably both. We'll need to investigate these cases further.Anyway, I'm attaching this here in case it will help someone get started... but I don't plan to polish it up to release quality. Hopefully someone will find it useful. Created attachment 59222Adds an example view to the o.e.ui.tests pluginThis patch adds an example view called ""Layout Constraints Test"". It has:- Adjustable minimum and maximum horizontal and vertical sizes.- Adjustable resolution for horizontal and vertical quantized sizes (for example, it can be set up to make the horizontal sash jump so that the view's width is always a multiple of 10 pixels)- Optional fixed area constraint. When enabled, it tries to maintain the area of the view such that the view always covers the given number of pixels. Although silly, the logic is similar to that of a view that would try to match the size of a wrapping widget.- Buttons to enable/disable the constraints, and to clone the view. (In reply to comment #38)> Anyway, I'm attaching this here in case it will help someone get started... but> I don't plan to polish it up to release quality. Hopefully someone will find it> useful.Thanks Stefan!  I looked at the patch and it seems to work fairly well, but I agree that this needs more work before it can be put into the default presentation.  In particular, it needs to be off by default for the IDE for now because of the risk of potentially screwing the workbench layout.  Could be a preference, or something that can be configured at the advisor level.Does anyone from the community care about this enough to help out?  We are almost there.  Craig? Brandon? Chris? I'm happy to help out where I can, although I must admit I'm relatively new to the inner workings of Eclipse so I'll probably need some help to get me started.  I can definitely spend some hours testing or doing additional dev work over the next few weeks if someone can take a bit of time to get me started and show me what I need to do.Please feel free to drop me an e-mail with details of what you need me to do.Brandon Since I don't have experience in working with the internals of Eclipse, I will also need a bit of help to get started.  http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-UI-Workbench/workbench.html is a good start for understanding the workbench internals.Here is what I believe remains to be done:- Making sure that the important use cases are covered.- Testing (using Stefan's example view in various layouts, but also variants of it like a standalone view, a detached view). For example, I noticed that sometimes, sashes are not draggable when they should be.- Finishing Stefan's implementation: taking trim size into account.- Fixing Bugs.- Determining how best to make the new behaviour optional, e.g. using a preference, or a configuration method on Workbench(Window)Advisor, and implementing this.- Making sure that the Javadoc for the new API is complete, and requesting permission for the necessary API changes from the PMC.The last two of these would have to be done pretty soon (deadline: beginning of the week after EclipseCon, say March 13) because of the upcoming API freeze for 3.3.  We would also have to be sure that any remaining issues/bugs can be fixed during the M7 development cycle, because otherwise it will be hard to get PMC permission for the API change.Note that some of these things become easier if we decided (e.g. for 3.3) that the new behaviour is only supported for standalone views.  This would make it easier to test, to compute the trim size, to fix bugs, and to specify the behaviour.I hope I didn't scare you off by this.  Welcome to working on a platform! Setting target milestone to 3.3M6.  I'm optimistic ;-) IMHO, if we're confident with the implementation, it should be on by default. Whoever implements a view that uses constraints will want this behavior. Letting them have it by default will encourage them to use the workbench's layout rather than rolling their own part framework within their editors and views.> sashes are not draggable when they should beCould you elaborate? The sashes should always be draggable if there's anywhere they could possibly move, but they shouldn't always move with the cursor during dragging (for example, they should stop when they hit the maximum size of a view, even if you move the cursor farther).Just for discussion (not required for this fix):I think there *may* be a bug in the workbench's layout or the example I included. You can see it in the example view - if you turn on horizontal quantizing and try to drag the sash, half of the time the sash will drag in discrete jumps, and sometimes it will drag smoothly. I think the problem is here in the example view:+		if (result > availableParallel) {+			result = availableParallel;+		}I'll bet that availableParallel is being set exactly the remaining space in the workbench, after computing the space for the unconstrained part... so when the part says that its preferred width is bigger than the current sash position, the request gets ignored.Of course a workaround would be to ensure that the example never asks for more than the workbench's preferred size:change this:result = result + (quant / 2) - ((result + quant / 2) % quant);to this:result = result - (result % quant);That should make the quantizing work nicely, but the sash will always jump to one side of the cursor rather than remaining as close to the cursor as possible... I'm not sure if it would even be possible to resolve this sort of constraint - in which case we should consider it a bug in my example - I just wanted to draw attention to the problem. Actually, now that I think of it, The example should be doing this:// If we're using quantized sizes, jump to the nearest multiple // of the -quantized sizeif (quant != ISizeProvider.INFINITE && quant != 0) {        result = Math.min(result + quant / 2, availableParallel);	result = result - (result % quant);}...it should try to put the sash in the quantized position as close to the cursor as possible -- IF the space is available. Otherwise, it will put it at the next available position. I no longer think there is anything wrong with the workbench. This is a bug in my example view. <Pyinson Data Over Head> > Not sure if I'm ready to commit to writing the actual code, but I am happy to> help with ideas, or in testing any proposed solution.Thanks for your help. Unfortunately, it seems that we ran out of time for M6 - this week is the last week of development for M6. Can we get this in 3.4 ? I have re-worked Stefan's patch (see comment #38) for Eclipse 3.3, and included the code to take trim size into account. It will be a few days before I have time to get this into a cvs patch format, but when I do, I will attach the patch. (In reply to comment #50)> I have re-worked Stefan's patch (see comment #38) for Eclipse 3.3Great! Looking forward to it. Created attachment 76344Patch against Eclipse 3.3 that implements this enhancementPatch against Eclipse 3.3 that implements this enhancement.This patch is a modification of Stefan's patch (see comment #38). The patch is against the latest (14 Aug 2007) code base.Changes from Stefan's original patch:1. TabbedStackPresentation: in computePreferredSize(), getSizeFlags() and addPart(), instead of using getSelectedPart, simply use the one-and-only stack part. This fixes a bug in Stefan's patch where you would detach a view, then reattach the view, and it wouldn't honor the view's preferred size because the view would not have been selected yet.2. TabbedStackPresentation: added a private computePreferredMinimumSize() method, used within computePreferredSize(). This now takes into account the tab and border trim.3. DetachedWindow: added an updateMinimumSize method, that takes into account the preferred size of the first view added to the detached window. Also made DetachedWindow be a listener of the AbstractTabFolder within the TabbedStackPresentation.Remaining to be done:1. Code verification and testing.2. Add the appropriate JavaDoc.I added one sentence to IPresentablePart, stating:   @since 3.4 now extends {@link org.eclipse.ui.ISizeProvider}I don't know if that is the correct format, or the correct version number.We should also add JavaDoc about the ability for views to implement ISizeProvider. I was not sure where to put this JavaDoc: WorkbenchPart? ViewPart?Overall Behavior:If you have a View Part that implements ISizeProvider, and it is the only part in a stack, then the size constraints for that View Part will be used for the stack. If there is more than one part in the stack, the constraints will be disabled for that stack. The size constraints are adjusted for the size of the tab and border trim.If your View Part is detached from the workbench, and it is the first view added to the detached window, then the minimum size constraints (if any) for that view are used to constrain the minimum size of the detached window. Note that the maximum size constraints are ignored.I will submit a modification of Stefan's example. Created attachment 76347Modified example view to the o.e.ui.tests pluginModification of Stefan's example view. This updates the code to Eclipse 3.3 (code base as of 14 Aug 2007).Changes:1. Made the button text shorter.2. Changed the ""Clear Constraints"" button to ""Reset"", and had it actually reset all of the widget values and trigger a layout update.3. Applied Stefan's example code fix (see comment #46). Created attachment 76462updated patchUpdated patch with contribution comments, and Javadoc changes. CC'ing Eric - could you please double-check this patch? Thanks.My plan is to release this in its current form to make it easy to use for RCP application developers.(from comment #26)> The advisor could still control whether requests for resize are honoured> though.For now, the new behaviour is enabled for all applications. Just a heads up that I might add API to the workbench advisor later in 3.4 which has to be called to enable this. The problem for the IDE, or any extensible RCP application, is that allowing views to specify their size can lead to difficult-to-understand cases where users might file bugs about (e.g.) not being able to drag a sash, etc. When I showed this to Eric, he had two ideas for improvement:1 - A RCP application might want to control the sizes of pre-existing views (e.g. Outline, Properties). For this to work, we might want to allow adapting view parts to ISizeProvider rather than requiring them to implement it directly.2 - It would be nice if the test view included a text area showing the concrete implementations of getSizeFlags() and computePreferredSize() for easy copy-and-pasting into real view part implementations.

Just a quick clarification: I assume that I would only need to modify the TabbedStackPresentation where we do the ""instanceof"".

This doesn't seem too useful as sample code, and the developer can always just look at the source for LayoutConstraintsView. It would be great if it could only show the sample code for the exact combination of settings, but that would be very tricky given the number of different combinations. Perhaps we could just include some ""real world"" examples in the JavaDoc? (In reply to comment #57)> This is a good idea. Just a quick clarification: I assume that I would only> need to modify the TabbedStackPresentation where we do the ""instanceof"". (WeI believe the change would be in WorkbenchPartReference. Change the two occurrences of:    if (part instanceof ISizeProvider) {  ...to:    ISizeProvider sizeProvider = (ISizeProvider) org.eclipse.ui.internal.util.Util.getAdapter(part, ISizeProvider.class);    if (sizeProvider != null) {  ...> Right now, in the test view, the getSizeFlags() and computePreferredSize() are> just a bunch of ""if"" blocks that handle all of the different possibilities.Can't you just create methods getSizeFlagsString() and computePreferredSizeString() that returns a string with the method source that would implement the current behaviour? For example,public int getSizeFlagsString() {  StringBuffer result = new StringBuffer();  result.append(""public int getSizeFlags(boolean width) {\n"");  int flags = 0;  result.append(""\tif (width) {\n"");  result.append(""\treturn 0 |"");  if (minWidth != ISizeProvider.INFINITE) {    result.append("" SWT.MIN"");  }  if (maxWidth != ISizeProvider.INFINITE) {    result.append("" SWT.MAX"");  }...Anyway, this was just an idea, don't feel obliged to implement it. Created attachment 76508updated patch with adapter and better sample viewHere's the patch, which addresses both issues in comment #56.1. Your ViewPart now just needs to adapt to ISizeProvider. I also updated the JavaDoc in IViewPart by simply changing ""views may optionally implement..."" to ""views may optionally adapt to..."".2. Enhanced the example view to include a text pane with sample code. Despite my reluctance (see comment #57), it was actually fun to code up. In general this looks fine.Constrained View issues:Main presentation:Generally speaking it has to be used with care; you can create incompatible layouts very easily.Detached Windows / Fast Views:Note that due to the current FV layout strategy it will be unable to honor the constraints in 'orientation' direction (i.e. 'horizontal' views -always- get the complete width of the Workbench Window and similarly for 'vertical' views getting the complete -height-. I think I can live with that...;-). Note that we should re-visit this if we change the ways that FV's appear (which is a distinct possibility in 3.4).Maximums and quantization aren't handled. I realize that this is because of the lack of a Shell#setMaximumSize method. How necessary are constrained maximums? IF we can't honor them in any but a small subset of cases then we should at least j'doc the contrsints on the constraints...Finally, a small nit. Then 'generated' code might look more readable if you defined local static fields and used them instead of hardcoding the actual values. This would make it more obvious to folks who may be coming into the code in the future to figure out what's going on. I'm not sure but it might be possible to actually code up the methods statically (i.e. they never change) based on the values of the various fields...just a thought. Patch released to HEAD >20070827.  The next I build (I20070828-0800) will contain the changes. Please grab the build if you can and give it a try. I would suggest dealing with any remaining issues in separate bugs.Thanks for your help! I just tried the version from I20070828-0010, and it works as expected. Thanks very much to Stefan for creating the initial patch and to Boris for driving it to completion! (In reply to comment #62)> I just tried the version from I20070828-0010, and it works as expected.Marking as verified. I am unsure if this needs to be IP-reviewed. The original work was done by Stefan Xenos, a committer on Platform UI at the time. Chris took the original patch and made it compile (and work) for 3.3.  The same is true of the example view, which was originally written by Stefan and then improved by Chris. I was under the impression that Chris' contribution was only a few lines of code (10 to 20) in the actual patch, plus some work on the example view which I estimated to be about 100 to 150 lines of code. Chris, does this sound right? Boris, that is correct. I took Stefan's original patch, and made some slight modifications, as described in comment #52. The main changes were to have the TabbedStackPresentation take into account the tab and border trim, as well as make sure the preferred size was honored for a detached view. My changes were probably about 20 lines of Stefan's code.Perhaps there is concern because the patch has exposed some other bugs? Bug 202208 had to do with using the new ISizeProvider interface with a standalone view with no title. This bug was exposed by the new interface, and the patch for 202208 simply required a check for parts without tabs.Bug 210424 states that a minimized view fails to expand adjacent views. This required a fix to the patch. However, it looks like this was exposed by the new minimize view behavior, and is only a problem in Eclipse 3.4. I tried this with Eclipse 3.3 (with a hacked version of org.eclipse.ui.workbench that contained the 51580 patch), and there was no problem with minimized views. Regarding my previous comment, I don't think I directly answered the question about IP issues. I thought you were referring to the ""quality"" of the patch, from an outside contributer versus an internal committer.Regarding IP, our company (ITT Visual Information Solutions) is willing (and happy) to contribute code back to the Eclipse community, under the terms of the Eclipse Public License (EPL). If you need any more information, or a signed consent form, feel free to contact me. I don't have any concerns about the quality of the code. Follow-up bugs are just a fact of life.The context for my question was that the Eclipse Foundation requires IP review (was original work submitted, as opposed to e.g. code copied from somewhere else) for any contribution over 250 lines of code coming from a non-committer. I was arguing that your contribution was less than that.Can you give a number for how many lines you authored in the example view, too? Doing a quick diff, I added about 180 lines to Stefan's original example code. My English not so good, I do not know whether the contents of the above resolve my needs £ºIn my RCP application, I have three perspectives, let's call them P1, P2, P3.At the left side of the editor area, I have a view folder, and there are three views stacked, call them V1, V2, V3, these three views act as ""NavigateView"", and these views will be shown in each perspective, and when one of these views is activated, it will activate the corresponding perspective, for example, if V1 activated, P1 will be activated.(V2 -> P2, V3 -> P3)..The problem is:By default, the folder has different width value for each perspective (the initial width was same, but if user resize the folder when P1 is activated, and switch to P2, the width of the folder is not same with previous resized value)I want to keep the same width of the folder (three views) when perspective was changed. I think what I want is the ability to resize the folder, It seems that ISizeProvider cannot resolve this? May be I misunderstood it because of my poor english?If anyone can read this and give me a help?Thanks very much. (In reply to comment #69)> I want to keep the same width of the folder (three views) when perspective was> changed. I think ISizeProvider could help, but it looks like there's a bug in our code when handling multiple views in the same stack that adapt to ISizeProvider.Here's some example code I used to experiment, and sometimes a stack with two views using this code behaved as you'd like it to (constrained to 300 pixel width) but sometimes the stack was resizable. I'd say it's worth experimenting, and ideally finding the bug and contributing a fix in a new bug report. :-)// Sample implementation: Make sure your ViewPart adapts to ISizeProvider.// Then implement the following two methods./* (non-Javadoc) * @see org.eclipse.ui.ISizeProvider#getSizeFlags(boolean) */public int getSizeFlags(boolean width) {	int flags = 0;	if (width) {		flags |= SWT.MIN;		flags |= SWT.MAX;	} else {	}	return flags;}/* (non-Javadoc) * @see org.eclipse.ui.ISizeProvider#computePreferredSize(boolean, int, int, int) */public int computePreferredSize(boolean width, int availableParallel,	int availablePerpendicular, int preferredResult) {	int result = preferredResult;	if (width) {		// Ensure we go no smaller than the minimum size		if (result < 300) result = 300;		// Ensure we go no larger than the maximum size		if (result > 300) result = 300;	} else {	}	// Ensure that we do not use more than the available space	if (result > availableParallel) result = availableParallel;	if (result < 0) result = 0;	return result;} Thank you Boris.But I think you don't know clearly about what I need.I don't want a ""FIXED"" width value of the views, I just want to keep the same width of the views between two perspectives.In other words, when user resize the view in Perspective1 and switch into  Perspective2, I want the width value of the view in P2 is same with the value in P1. I don't know the numeric value of the width, this numeric value is decided by user's resize operation.Here's my use case:I'm working on a RCP application looks like Microsoft Outlook, there are some navigate views at the left side of workbench, like Contacts, Mail, Tasks etc. and I wrote my own presentations looks like Outlook (also like org.eclipse.nebula.widgets.collapsiblebuttons)Each navigate view has a corresponding perspective and some other views are contributed into this perspective from org.eclipse.ui.perspectiveExtensions, and when user activate one navigate view, the corresponding perspective will be activated.What I want is to keep the width value of navigate views same between perpectives.Thanks very much. Sorry, I don't think the current infrastructure supports what you need.  You should have better luck with e4 where you can get hold of the underlying model of the perspectives, stacks, and views and manipulate the model to keep the sizes in sync. But that's only coming together now, not sure if it's worth porting your application to use e4 just because of this one feature. (In reply to comment #72)Thank you very much, Boris. You really helped me.Now I have an idea:1. Attach a PerspectiveListener to the WorkbenchWindow	window.addPerspectiveListener(new PerspectiveAdapter() {....});2. Get the width of the view's container when the previous perspective is about to be deactivated.	public void perspectivePreDeactivate(IWorkbenchPage page, IPerspectiveDescriptor perspective) {		width = container.getSize().x; //Assume that the value is equal to 365.	}3, When the target perspective is activated, call firePropertyChange of the view with the propertyId ""PROP_PREFERRED_SIZE"":	view.firePropertyChange(IWorkbenchPartConstants.PROP_PREFERRED_SIZE);4. Now I can use getSizeFlags and computePreferredSize to tell the underlying infrastructure that I want the view to have the width equals to 365 and finally please allow the user can resize the view.The problem is that I am not very clear with the mechanism of ISizeProvider.

You could try changing your size constraints to a fixed width of 365 first, and then removing the size constraint immediately. But you're on your own now, trying to trick the system. Good luck!

51794	[Keybindings] Keybindings displayed but not working	"We place a ""Zoom In"" action on our own menu on the menubar.  It is a global action.  The editor provides the action handler which registers its ID with the site's service.  The keybinding appears in the menu, but does not work.  The menuitem is working properly otherwise. In what project is the action defined?  Where in the menu bar does it appear? What is the key binding?Typical things to look for:+ The key binding conflicts with another key binding, and is hence disregarded.+ The action definition ID does not match up with a defined key binding.Another question:Is this stop-ship for M7? the action definition is in gef's plugin.xml:   <extension         point=""org.eclipse.ui.commands"">      <category            name=""%ViewCategory.Label""            description=""%ViewCategory.Label""            id=""org.eclipse.gef.category.view"">      </category>      <command            name=""%ZoomIn.Tooltip""            description=""%ZoomIn.Tooltip""            category=""org.eclipse.gef.category.view""            id=""org.eclipse.gef.zoom_in"">      </command>      <keyBinding            string=""Ctrl+=""            scope=""org.eclipse.ui.globalScope""            command=""org.eclipse.gef.zoom_in""            configuration=""org.eclipse.ui.defaultAcceleratorConfiguration"">      </keyBinding>      <command            name=""%ZoomOut.Tooltip""            description=""%ZoomOut.Tooltip""            category=""org.eclipse.gef.category.view""            id=""org.eclipse.gef.zoom_out"">      </command>      <keyBinding            string=""Ctrl+-""            scope=""org.eclipse.ui.globalScope""            command=""org.eclipse.gef.zoom_out""            configuration=""org.eclipse.ui.defaultAcceleratorConfiguration"">      </keyBinding>   </extension>The code to register the actions for each editor instance get's run during the editor's creation:IAction zoomIn = new ZoomInAction(root.getZoomManager());IAction zoomOut = new ZoomOutAction(root.getZoomManager());getSite().getKeyBindingService().registerAction(zoomIn);getSite().getKeyBindingService().registerAction(zoomOut);The actions set their own descriptor IDs in their constructor, which is why the accelerators do show up.  But, they just don't work.As far as keybindings conflicting, I'm sure that in that case the binding wouldn't be displayed in the menuitem, right ;-) Can you run with the key bindings debugging options set?  I don't have GEF, andhave never installed it.  Try using your keyboard shortcut.  Output to stdoutwill be the key down event received by the key bindings, as well as the decisionit made.  This should clear up what's going on.The relevant debugging options are in ""org.eclipse.ui"" and they are:# Reports events received and dispatched by the key binding architectureorg.eclipse.ui/trace/keyBindings=true# Report every event received by the key binding architectureorg.eclipse.ui/trace/keyBindings.verbose=trueThanks. Well, I would love to turn on those tracing options, but every time I turn them on in the PDE launcher and then Run, when I come back, the options are false again. Installing GEF is no different than installing eclipse. we are packaged *exactly* the same way on the same site :-) Ah, I just meant run Eclipse with those options -- not a PDE launcherself-hosted thing.Though it does work for me.  You specify ""-debug/home/dpollock/Source/Eclipse/eclipseDebuggingOptions.txt"" in the ""ProgramArguments"".  Then put those options in the text file you're pointing at.I put in these debugging options so that I don't have to try to set up areproducible environment.  A lot of things can cause key bindings resolution tohappen differently -- installed plugins, locale, platform, etc.  These debuggingoptions provide me just enough information to rule out a bunch of those rightoff the top.Though, I guess, I'm really just being lazy.  :P  Could you please try thedebugging options again?  Thanks....

No, it does not. It looks like we moved the descriptor ID to the retargeting action (instead of the action handler).  If I set the descriptor ID on BOTH actions, it works:Here is the current behavior:1) Set the descriptorID on the action handler and the keybinding works correctly but does not appear in the menu2) Set the descriptorID on the global action and the keybinding is displayed in the menu but does not work.It seems like it shouldn't be necessary to do both.  I think I have opened a previous bugzilla discussing how EditorActionbarContirbutor does not have access to the keybinding service, and therefore the global action cannot register itself.See bug 33666.Same 2 issues remain:1) If the global action is not registered with service, why does it display the keybinding in the menuitem?2) If the action handler *IS* registered, why doesn't RetargetAction refresh the MenuItem to display the action handler's registered keybinding??*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 33666 *** Moving duplicate resolved (but not fixed) bugs to verified for M8.

51704	multiple beginCompoundChange in LinkedUIKeyListener	"build used: eclipse-SDK-I20040210-win32I noticed some strange undo/redo behavior in the JDT Editor. I don't have a simple testcase to demonstrate the problem in the JDT Editor. But, I noticed if I set a breakpoint at the implementation of IRewriteTarget.beginCompoundChange, it's called multiple times while I'm in the linked edit mode of Local Rename (one time for each keystroke). But, endCompoundChange was only called one time at the end.I traced and noticed the origin of the multiple beginCompoundChange calls came from the LinkedUIKeyListener#controlUndoBehavior(int, int). LinkedUIKeyListener is an inner class in LinkedUIControl. I understand org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.text.link is an internal package. But, I hope the developer may agree that it's a simple problem to fix. That may avoid some hard-to-explain problems in the future because of this unmatching beginCompoundChange/endCompoundChange calls.Here is a copy of LinkedUIKeyListener#controlUndoBehavior(int, int). You may notice that target.beginCompoundChange() is called everytime position is not null.private boolean controlUndoBehavior(int offset, int length) {    LinkedPosition position=        fEnvironment.findPosition(new LinkedPosition(            fCurrentTarget.getViewer().getDocument(), offset, length,                LinkedPositionGroup.NO_STOP));    if (position != null) {        ITextViewerExtension extension=            (ITextViewerExtension) fCurrentTarget.getViewer();        IRewriteTarget target= extension.getRewriteTarget();        if (fPreviousPosition != null && !fPreviousPosition.equals(position))            target.endCompoundChange();        target.beginCompoundChange();    }    fPreviousPosition= position;    return fPreviousPosition != null;} I do agree :-)I recently fixed another instance inside LinkedUIControl that calledbeginCompoundChange too often, but overlooked the instance you are pointing out.Hopefully for M7 Fixed in source, will release into HEAD after review fixed for M7introduced explicit state in LinkedUIControl start verifying verified ok . Created attachment 7887stack trace for multiple beginCompoundChange in LinkedUIKeyListener Kit, does attachement 7887 have anything to do with this fix? What build numberdid you produce the traces with? I believe this was fixed in I200402120800. Hi Tom, we use the ""Linked Position Infrastructure"" to implement ""Local Rename"" QuickAssist proposal in our editor. I just tried the fix in eclipse-SDK-I20040212-win32 build, but is still seeing multiple beginCompoundChange in LinkedUIKeyListener.Our UndoManager supports nested compound changes by keeping a counter. We won't exit the ""recording"" of compound changes until the counter is back to zero.I printed the stack trace and recordingCount while I was performing our ""Local Rename"". I noticed that beginCompoundChange is still called multiple times with just one endCompoundChange at the end. Please investigate. - what build exactly (the fix did not go into the first 200402120010 build)?- do you see the same problem when performing a local rename operation in theJava editor? I checked using similar breakpoints as you seem to use, and allcompoundChange calls were properly nested.Ok, I just looked closely at attachement 7887. Note this line in the second trace:	atorg.eclipse.jface.text.TextViewer$RewriteTarget.beginCompoundChange(TextViewer.java:926)	atorg.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.text.link.LinkedUIControl.switchPosition(LinkedUIControl.java:774)If you look at the current builds, you will notice thatLinkedUIControl.switchPosition does not call beginCompoundChange any longer. ->you used a build one too early.Marking a closed, please reopen if you disagree. I downloaded another copy of the eclipse-SDK-I20040212-win32 integration build. The size IS different! I guess I got the first one. The new one fixed the problem.

51503	Add filter button to Expressions view to show expressions by debug target	"Similar to the breakpoints view add a button that would filter the expressions by debug target. This feature request is to fiter the expression view to those IExpressions/IWatchItems that are applicable to a specific debug model (based on the selected debug target, if any, similar to the breakpoints view). A watch item will only be associated with a debug target at launch time, and thus the ""binding"" of a watch item is not always known (not sure if we should show ""unbound"" watch items all the time, or only when bound & known).  IWatchExpressions have no link to debug targets; they're just strings.IExpressions are connected to a debug target, but it seems awkward to provide a view filter that applies to some of the items in the view, but not others. Move to WONTFIX this. A watch expression delegate can be contributed for a debug model. The only time a watch expression is ""not supported"" is when the selected debug element (model) does not contribute a watch expression delegate. The same ""watch expression"" can be applied to many targets (for example ""i""). I agree that a filter is not intuitive, but rather to show when watch expressions are *not* supported for the selected target would be useful (and we know this, since there will be no contributed delegate for the model). Can we just provide dummy values in this case that show ""unsupported"", or something of the sort? Could the watch expressions be disabled (greyed)or removed if the debug target has not contributed a delegate. It turns out that we were totally not handling the case where a debugger didn't register an expression delegate. We'd actually blow up with an NPE in WatchExpression.

49165	[preferences] Selection Background Color	Java Editor Settings. Editor Apperance/Syntax.I did not find how to specify selection's background color. By default it's blue. Problem is more noticable if set Custom Background Color to blue. Then in editor selected blocks are becoming blue on blue. Selection background is determined from your OS settings for text background . Change them there and they will be reflected in the java editor.I will move to JDT who supply this editor but I don't think any action is required on thier part. Thanks Tod,Even if there's a way to specify selection text background/foreground color on OS level I don't think user wants change these settings. I want to set up my IDE only, not anything else.If I can do it in VBA Editor, Visual Studio, Borland IDEs, Intellij why there is a problem in Eclipse? It was a design decision in Eclipse to honour the users workbench settings as much as possible - not picking up changes in the OS is a great frustration to many people - especially in platforms that support themes. It's the right decision to pick up the OS settings, no doubtsbut since Eclipse allows to change background color for plain text it would be logical to allow specify background color for selected text as well.

Did the Mac on which the tests are run change in any way, like an update to the OS? I just checked the mac and I don't see any software updates. Running Snippet25 does not show the problem on my Mac (for what it's worth).  The problem could be in Display.post().  We're looking into it ... There is nothing for us to debug.  It works when we sit in front of the machine.  Please open a new bug with steps, more information etc. Sorry, I forgot to update this bug.We had the following two results:Build M20070918-1350:  All tests pass.Build M20070921-1145:  Test failures in org.eclipse.ui.tests_macosx.carbon.ppc_5.0I found no relevant code changes between M20070918-1350 and M20070921-1145, i.e. no change at all in SWT, an unrelated change in Platform UI, and no changes in any other components.Kim Moir said that when she ran the tests from M20070918-1350 again, there was a failure.  So it is either an intermittent failure or something changed on the Mac we use for the builds.Given that we cannot reproduce this on other Macs, I agree that there is nothing we can do right now.

27122	Unclear text in Code Formatter|Style panel of Preferences	Martin, we should consider the wording improvements.We can't gray out the second if the first option is selected. Consider the case that a file uses spaces for indention (it got imported without reformatting) then we use the number of spaces representing a tab to convert spaces into the right number of tabs.  As far as I can tell, you do not 'use the number of spaces representing a tab toconvert spaces into the right number of tabs' on a reformat operation. You dowhat you should, which is to use the control flow elements of the code itself toreformat the code. So if I bring in a file with spaces, and reformat, you ignorethe existing spaces, and indent with tabs, using an extra tab for each deeperlevel of code. This seems to apply to comments tooSo on this basis, I think you could grey out the 2nd (Number of spacesrepresenting a tab) option if the first is checked. Am I missing something? Doyou actually use the value from the 2nd option anywhere if the first is checked? What you say is correct for a reformat of a whole file.But there are many operations on code that e.g. insert new code and have to fit in the existing structure, by using the settings from the code formatter.Example is the shift-right operation that reduces the indent of a file, it needs the 'spaces representing a tab' option even if you configured to only use tabs (for new files). changed the labels as suggested- Insert &tabs for indentation, not spaces- &Number of spaces representing an indentation level> 20030117 A couple of options on the Code Formatter|Style panel of the Preferences isreally unclear in my opinion. I am talking about  Indentation is represented by a tab  Number of spaces representing a tabThe first option would be clearer if it said something like  Use hard tabs for indentation, not spacesor something to that effect, like  Insert tabs for indentation, not spaces  Insert hard tabs for indentation, not spacesThe second one is really bad though. It has nothing to do with tabs, but ratherthe number of spaces to use when indenting, when tabs are turned off (e.g. ifthe first option is not checked). So, first of all, it should be greyed out ifthe first option is selected, since it will have no effect in that case. And thedescription should be changed to something clearer, like:  Number of spaces to insert per indentation level.  Number of spaces representing an indentation level.etc. That, together with the fact that it will be greyed out if tabs are turnedon, will make it clearer how both of these options work.Every person I know who has used Eclipse has been confused by how these twosettings work, in relationship with the the setting on the Appearance pane ofthe Editor area which also has a setting for displayed tab width, and the othersetting on the Editor|Behaviour pane which has a setting for 'Insert Spaces forTabs'. 	2004-02-20 21:09:17	1077330000.0	resolved fixed	4161179	1306100000.0	java/org/apache/catalina/authenticator/AuthenticatorBase.java
51185	[New Look] 'Show multiple editor tabs' should be on by default	"200401290841I strongly believe that the new 'single-tab editor' feature is something that is only for power-users who know all of the keyboard accelerators. As such, it should not be the default setting. New users (and old users familiar with the previous multi-tab default) will think ""Where did my other editor go?"". (Old users will also think ""What happened to single-click editor navigation?"")In fact, I will go so far as to say that the single tab feature is only useful to ""power-users who know all of the keyboard accelerators and who have very long class name (or filename) prefixes that are all the same for large groups of classes"". As I - and arguably, most developers - do not fit into that category, I don't think it should be the default.To reiterate, here is a list of ""reasons why the single-tab editor feature should not be the default"". This list was originally in an email that was arguing for multi-tab editor capability, but now that it has been added, it needs to be the default, and the same old arguments still apply:a) New users, and old lazy users like me who use the mouse for navigation, don't know the keyboard accelerators. And they never will. The 1-tab will therefore seriously annoy a large group of users.b) New users won't even realize that they can switch to another editor - they will wonder where their other editor went.c) Can't see ""at a glance"" which editors are open.d) Can't see ""at a glance"" which editors have changes.e) The list of accelerators (keyboard shortcuts) is buried in a submenu - which is the appropriate place for them, but which makes them more difficult to find when a user is scanning the menus looking for shortcuts, because the typical method is to scan for accelerator text to the right of menu items.f) Editor navigation using the mouse used to be only one ""visual cue"" mouse click, whereas with 1-tab, you need to do mouse motion, click, then an extra mouse motion and an extra mouse click, making this very common interaction take twice as long as before.g) Editor navigation using the keyboard is difficult also, because I have to use 2 hands to type the accelerator (ctrl+F6). (I have small hands, and I just cannot do ctrl+F6 very easily with only one hand). See also:https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=47189 I agree with Carolyn.Carolyn: Comment 8 to bug 16221 might help you:Use Alt+` and Alt+Shift+` to switch editors. Thank-you, Markus - using the ` key for the various 'switching' accelerators is a fabulous idea. I set it up as Alt+` and Alt+Shift+` to switch perspectives (sorta like switching application windows), and Ctrl+` and Ctrl+Shift+` to switch between editors (sorta like switching MDI windows). I can definitely reach it with one hand, and it's hardly a paradigm shift at all because the ` key is so close to the tab key.Note that this does not negate any of the other reasons that 'multiple editors' should be the default. fixed in 3.0 "	2011-05-11 10:21:44	1305120000.0	resolved fixed	4bdd8d0	1305930000.0	modules/jdbc-pool/src/main/java/org/apache/tomcat/jdbc/pool/DataSourceProxy.java

51220	[formatter][api] ContentFormatter2 should pass indents based on partition	Typical implementations of ContextBasedFormattingStrategy keep a list ofpartitions to format individually, however each call into the FormattingStrategysends the same indent information (the region's initial indent) rather thanindentation information for each partition, which is not particularly helpfulwhen each partition may be indented differently. Created attachment 7702my fix for the ant formatterCompare this to ContentFormatter2 to see the problem and my solution.So far as I could tell from looking at the implementations ofContextBasedFormattingStrategy in the SDK, no one is actually using theindentation infomation passed off from ContentFormatter2 so perhaps this issuecould be addressed with a fix to ContentFormatter2. Then again, it is API...Grr. (Though it migh be worth a look to see how the contract is actuallyexpressed in the JavaDoc.) Adapted the summary since the formatter does pass the indent.Why do you want another indent? Do you need an additional argument which givesyou the indent of the partition. I need a partition level indent when formatting an XML tag. With the existingpartioner for the ant editor I get a single tag in each partition. I format thetag when the attributes and attribute values extend over the margin. I then wantthe tag indent so that I can properly indent each attribute & attribute value.Please see the attached code and the code for the ant formatter in bug 40255.

If you were actually connected and there were errors, would you expect to see logged errors?I am marking this as an enhancement, as it is not really a bug. I would disagree that this is not a bug. It's just not a very serious one, but it is clearly a bug and not an enhancement. (Except in the sense that having fewer bugs is an enhancement! ;=).But regardless:If I am connected, and Comcast or some other router somewhere is out to lunch, or the target site has a power outage or something, no, I would not care to have this appear in the log! This is just a normal aspect of the environment.Here's what I suggest: Log only successful updates (with no stack trace!). You can see in the log how long it has been since a successful connection. You COULD also warn when the site has been unavailable for an extended time, say a week or so.Remember, a failed automatic connection is of little import, because it will be retried unti it succeeds anyway.Foreground failures (i.e. by explicit user request from the menu item) should be reported immediately to the user -- but not logged on failure, only on success, as only the success has any impact on changing the environment. I mostly agree with your comments, with one general exception: when somethings goes wrong, product support teams may need to see the error/activity log. Deciding what should or should not go in the log is not rocket science, but is not personal preferences either.For example: for user triggered update via the ui: if something failed and the user must call the support line, he needs to provide some record of the problem, so a logged network problem would probably be good. Making the right logging choice is less critical for infrequent events, and often erring on the side of extra information for support helps in the long run. So logging the failuire in the event of a user-initiated update doesn't bother me -- but it only adds value if the customer wouldn't report the failure reported in the dialog, and if support would make use of the information.One approach is to log information like this to a separate, short-lived log. This can include the last several recent commands and other information which you would not be able to log otherwise but which might help support. (Efficiency becomes an issue, but a buffered log with asynchronous formatting, and minimal amounts of text is usually acceptable for all except things like mouse motion events!) I like the idea of a log frame that logs the most recent events separately, although, with some pseudo chaos theory, one could argue the first, oldest event affects is the cause for the most recent one :-)Anyway, this is going on a different tangent, so for now, I will leave the bug open and consider investigating the amount of logging during automatically scheduled updates. I don't believe that automatic updates that fail should prompt the user inregard to the failure. If the user initiated the update then by means provideinformation on it failing. However, there are plenty of mobile users that willhave the machines disconnected from the network when an automatic update occurs.It is certainly fine to leave an error icon in the lower right hand cornerallowing the user to be notified of the problem without being interuptted. I'll add that I have had to turn off automatic updates, since it pops up a dialog these days. This is very much a bug, as it renders the feature unusable for a significant population.

50950	Progress dialog should provide description of ongoing task	"Build 20040128When getting the progress dialog to report a conflict with some background activity, it is not mentionning which task is colliding with others. This is very misleading as you can only see description of other jobs. This is a status that I am provided from Core. Are you talking about the message that says ""The operation cannot proceedbecause it is blocked by: <name of job>""?  You want to know what ""The operation"" is?The problem is, core is just passed a progress monitor, which has no API forquerying the name of the top level task.

Couldn't Eclipse's replace simplybe rewritten so that it substitutes \aGroupNumber for $aGroupNumber in thereplace string before applying it? Something like:matcher.replaceAll(replaceString.replaceAll(""\\\\(\\d)+"", ""\\$$1""));If that's the case, can I reopen this as a feature request?I think it would be better to use a widely adopted convention rather than oneunique to Java regex that's not documented. Yes you can enter such a feature request. But first we have to verifiy what theplan for the regex package is i.e. maybe it gets fixed there. I opened bug 51530 as a feature request.

Which VM are you using ?Were you using conditionnal breakpoints ? or watch expressions ?The stack trace was generated by an exception during an evaluation, it may be anerror that occured before the crash. Do you have any idea of which evaluationcould have generated this error ? Well, since I wasn't stepping through the debugger in a debugger, I can't be certain that the exception in the log is really the one that killed it. Here's what I CAN say:* The exception in the log was very close in time to when it died.* It seems much more likely to die if I use conditional breakpoints, and I was using one when it died this time.* I have since noted that I sometimes get deaths when debugging for which NO log entry occurs. This would support the idea that this wasn't the cause, but would also support the idea that there is an additional problem that is not logged.Either way, there is a problem where fatal errors are not logged. (In the meantime, the log is flooded with stack traces for every unsuccessful attempt to contact an update site -- realy a separate report of course, but pointed out here for the sake of irony. I'll report it so you needn't bother separating this out ;=). Bob: Can you try to launch Eclipse from a console, and try to crash it ? the VMshould print out data about why it died. I just discovered the separate log files it dumps in the root directory when it crashes. It seems this is an access violation in the SWT native code. I guess that would make this a platform problem.

50927	Difficulties with hidden files and folders	"I have difficulties understanding the policies for hiding files and directories on different platforms.On Unix and MacOS X the .metadata (and now the .config folders) are hidden.I have no problem with that.But I don't understand why most (but not all) files within these hidden directories are itself hidden too.On Unix and Mac OS X it is really a pain for ordinary users to find these hidden files (especially the .log file and now the .keyring files) within their hidden folders.And if a user has decided to look into a hidden folder .metadata, why can't she see the log file without further hassles?The additional odd thing here is that on Windows all this '.' business seems to have no effect at all, so ordinary users have access to everything in .metadata and .config without any hurdles.What am I missing here? This exact point was raised years ago. It is a valid argument, but questionablewhether it's worth the backwards compatibility pain that comes with renaming allour metadata files. I think this just became a convention without too muchthought going into it... as you said it never bothered anyone on Windows, andLinux command shell users just use ""ls -a"" to see them. I did notice that it wasparticulary hard to see these files on Mac, but interestingly my reaction was toblame the Mac UI for making the assumption that users will never want to seethese files. Even Windows lets me see hidden files if I want to :) I was raising this issue because we've just started to introduce another hidden folder "".config"" with a new set of hidden files and we do not seem to care a lot  about backward compatibility (e.g. .keyring :-) *** Bug 56988 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** You can do an ls -a in Mac OS X, too.

The import wizard could easily rename the files in ""old"" projects.It should prompt the user for permission to avoid unneccessary compatibilityproblems for users who need to be able to switch back to older versions. Andre, can you confirm whether copying a directory with Finder containing hiddenfiles will not copy the hidden files? I find this hard to believe... No, I cannot confirm this: I created a directory containg a file "".foo"", copied it in the Finder with Copy/Paste and the resulting duplicated folder still had the "".foo"".In addition, I don't understand why ""starting developing with eclipse on mac osx"" requires to copy invisible files...Even as a fulltime Eclipse developer, I only see a need for dealing with invisible files when debugging persistency stuff in .metadata (which was the original motivation why I've filed this bug).The .log file lives there too, but on Mac all log output is sent to the Console application by default, so there is no need to find the .metadata/.log I'm doing nothing special. I just copied projects from my windows pc to thenetwork (everything ok) then from the network share to the mac (lost the.projects files). Importing the projects into eclipse then obviously didn't work.The only workaround was to zip the projects first and then copy it to the mac. What network share are you exporting from the Mac? NFS, AFP or SMB?It might also be a problem with the Windows box in selecting the files,depending on the version of Windows that you've got installed. There's a viewoption that you can configure from an Explorer window (Tools -> Folder Options-> View -> Hidden Folders and Files -> Show hidden folders and files). If youdon't have this selected, then the Windows box may not upload dot files it toany remote box.This isn't anything to do with Eclipse per se; it's a combination of Windowscopying files to a remote share that's at fault. As already mentioned, the problem is not with windows but with the macos. Copying files from the windows pc to the network is no problem. The projectfolders on the network drive are ok, complete with project files and everything.But trying to copy the project folders to the local mac the finder always omitsthe (hidden) project files. The copy action is initiated by  dropping the rootfolder containing my projects folders (drag and drop).The result:pc: everything completenetwork drive: everything completemac: hidden project files missingMacosx 10.3.8network drive connected with appletalk (afp ?) PS: I have verified this with the shell (ls -a). You need to find out what the network drive is doing, and how you're mounting itor making it available on the mac. I've been able to do this with SMB(samba/windows file sharing), NFS and also AFP (the Apple Filing Protocol that'sused for sharing Mac-Mac shares) and all copy across the .project file fine.If your network drive is a standalone product (like a Lacie drive) then amake/model might be useful to know what server OS it's running to make themavailable. Chances are, it could be that the network drive is using an oldversion of Linux with an appletalk protocol that is automatically hiding the .files when the apple server asks for it ...Can you try the following mounts -- from Finder, Command+K to bring up aconnection window, and then try the following URLs:afp://mynetworkdrive/smb://mynetworkdrive/nfs://mynetworkdrive/and do the copies from each? You might find that the choice of network protocolmakes a difference; Mac can speak them all, but the network drive might have abroken AFP driver (the Linux 2.2 kernels were notoriously bad for such things).Windows should share it over SMB, so I'd expect to see that working exactly thesame way as the Windows box sees it. With smb it works so it must be a driver problem and I'll tell our sysadmins.But apart from that it is still problematic to use hidden files. The logfile problematic (see comment 4) is just one example of this. Moving to runtime.  The main issue seems to be with the .log file, which users often legitimately need to access.  The metadata files maintained by the resources plugin generally don't need to be seen by end users (with the exception of .project) Interestingly enough, among all the files that are hidden the one that matters the most is the one that is probably the most risky to change as it is tooled and expected to be in a welknown location. That said we can still investigate what it means to provide an option to rename it. Doesn't the workbench pick the name of the file by calling FrameworkLog#setFile when the workspace is choosen?  Looking at the EclipseLog code it seems that we do depend on a file name that ends in '.log' but other than that the framework does not care what the name is.As Pascal points out changing the file name will impact many others that depend on the file being just '.log'.  Also is changing the file name good enough?  Would we not also need to change the parent directory name (it is .metadata now when set by the workbench). *** Bug 134902 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** *** Bug 154230 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** We have no plans to make this change. I'm reopening this bug because it is still an issue that needs to be considered(at least newly introduced files and folders should *never* start with a '.')In addition I'm changing the summary (title) back to my original title:    ""Difficulties with hidden files and folders""I was never asking for ""Make the name of the log file parametrizable""so Thomas' resolution ""We have no plans to make this change""does not apply. Have you considered using visible symbolic links to the univisible files and folders?   Moving out of the Framework.  We have no plans to do anything about this issue in the framework. I'm not sure what is concretely being asked for us to do?  that is, what would we need to do to get this bug closed? - add an entry to http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/User_Interface_Guidelines that explains the issue (and provides a recommendation)- add a visible alias (link) for "".log"" (and may be "".metadata"") *** Bug 283406 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** *** Bug 283406 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** in the windows explorer you cannot name files or directories that start with a '.'.

50929	Provide UI for showing call graph affected by flow advice	The effects of cflow advice can be challenging to infer and currently get no help from the tool support.  Now the at the IDEs are starting to show static call graphs, we can use this information to give the programmer an idea of the execution that will be affected by a cflow advice.  The attached mock-up shows a first pass at how this could look in AJDT. Created attachment 7639mockup of cflow advice showing up in the outline view That looks good for a first approch, I think. However I see two general problems: Firstly as you know a static cflow analysis is impossible. That in mind, one can easily see that the call hierarchy search that Eclipse uses at the moment is very rudimentary sinc eit just works on declared types and does not even try to approximate the runtime type. So I don't really know how useful such information could be, if one in a lot of cases must fear the information to be wrong.However I tried to integrate some more sophisticated analysis for Elipse last summer but did not finish them due to lack of time.Secondly: Usually we always have a correspondency between advice and adviced methods. One can always go back and forth using the annotations. However for a cflow I guess nobody would really want to annotate all the methods that could possibly be in a specific control flow. That would lead to some kind of inconsistency, though not a big one I have to admit. 	2011-03-14 11:08:56	1300120000.0	resolved fixed	0c96676	1300230000.0	java/javax/servlet/http/HttpUtils.java java/org/apache/catalina/connector/CoyoteInputStream.java java/org/apache/catalina/realm/JDBCRealm.java java/org/apache/catalina/valves/JDBCAccessLogValve.java java/org/apache/naming/resources/WARDirContext.java java/org/apache/tomcat/util/digester/NodeCreateRule.java

50895	[navigation] Outline popup window has problems usability	"The outline popup window (Navigate->Show Outline), should persist size/position changes between invocations. As well, the mouse scroll wheel does not scroll the outline when moved while on top of the member list. I see the request for size persistence is a duplicate of 37513. The lack of mouse wheel scrolling is still an issue though.  For me mouse wheel scrolling works. Can you explain what you mean with""the mouse scroll wheel does not scroll the outline when moved while on top ofthe member list."" First I want to make sure we're both talking about the popup outline window and not the dockable one (mouse wheel works in that one). With the popup outline, as I move the mouse over the window, focus (and highlight) follows the mouse position, but the mouse wheel has no effect. Mouse wheel scrolling works in other parts of the UI (e.g. editor, navigator views, etc.).I tried to ensure the popup has focus, by clicking either in the text entry area at the top or the ""footer"" (non-list) part, but still can't scroll the list when cursor is positioned above it.Also, although the sizing persistence issue for this outline window is reported in other bugs, I didn't see any kind of resolution. Any reason why? On further playing around with the popup outline view, I got the mouse wheel to scroll the list by initiating scrolling through click-and-drag on a member and holding the cursor at the top or bottom list edge and then releasing outside the list borders. I can't always get this to happen - mostly it doesn't, but I did get it 2-3 times. >First I want to make sure we're both talking about the popup outline window and >not the dockable one (mouse wheel works in that one)I think Navigate > Show Outline from comment 0 says it already ;-)The reason why it is not working is because you probably set your mouse to onlytrack active windows, however the fast popup is not a full fledged window. Ifyou want your mouse to be able to scroll then enable it to also scrollnon-active windows, this will do the trick.BTW: clicking into entry field or footer cannot work: those widgets have noscroll bars - the scroll bars belong to the tree widget. I'm using Windows 2000 with a generic mouse driver (MS PS/2 compatible) and I don't see any option in the control panel applet to set any properties for the scroll wheel. The reason I was clicking on the entry field or footer was just to make sure that the popup the list was a child of _was_ the active window - I only attempted to scroll the list while the cursor was positioned above it. I'm at a loss then as to what to do since, as I mentioned before, scrolling with the wheel works fine with any other scrollable window/view.Also, could you say anything about the size persistence issue? Did you install the driver that comes with your mouse? This should offer toconfigure you this. No, it's just a cheapo MS compatible mouse - I suspect that the majority of people don't install a driver for their mouse and just use the default. This is my work machine, but I can say that even for my computer at home where I have a pretty good mouse, I didn't install the specific driver since, alongside, it installs some bloatware with features that are non-essential.  My standard WindowsXP mouse driver allows to set this - so maybe this isn'tavailable under Windows2000. Try a Win2k forum. Can confirm bug using a standard PS/2 on WinXP. Not even TweakUI offers toscroll non-active windows and even if I choose to activate the window over whichthe mouse is (again via TweakUI) scrolling does not work for the Quick Outline.Moving to SWT for comments.Note: we use the following flags:int shellStyle= SWT.RESIZE;int treeStyle= SWT.V_SCROLL | SWT.H_SCROLL; Mousewheel scrolling of non-active windows has been requested in the past, but swt is not going to get in the way of the platform to make it happen in places where it's not configured to.  While there are some applications like IE that do this, this is a feature of the application and not of the underlying widgets.*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 49816 *** All I can say is that without mouse wheel scrolling, the original summary of this bug - usability of the quick outline - is seriously affected since the other issue I brought up, the persistence of the popup window's size, doesn't look like it will be addressed. I mean if it is going against the platform behaviour to have scrolling in this case, the size of of the popup should be persisted so that the need for scrolling is be reduced. As it is, almost every time I use the quick outline, I have to resize it, and possibly drag the scroll bar button. Not too nice. Adrian, SWT will not override the default platform behavior.  If you think that the problem can be addressed somehow in Platform/UI (ie. ""... size of popup should be persisted ...""), reopen the bug there.  Thanks. OK, I've re-opened it under platform/UI - I think. The resizing issue has been addressed under bug 37513.

50855	Opening a very large sequence diagram hangs the UI	The vast majority of the time is spent loading the model, not drawing the diagram. There is a progress monitor dialog, but it is frozen and the user cannot cancel, even though the cancel button is enabled. All the work is still being done in the UI thread.The solution involves forking a new thread to perform all the work except UI work. As far as displaying progress, displaying a dialog may be too intrusive. I will consider alternatives. Solution:The EMF model and UI model will both be loaded in a background thread. While the diagram is loading, a loading page is displayed. As soon as the thread completes, it signals the UI thread to display the diagram.This allows the user to perform other tasks while waiting (it is not a blocking operation). If the user closes the view, the thread is signalled to stop, and will halt at the next appropriate time. It is the thread's responsibility to poll for this, otherwise the task will run to completion. If a new diagram is requested while loading, the current diagram is cancelled and a request is made to start on the new diagram. There is at most one thread loading diagrams at any time, and it will terminate itself when no longer needed.If the user refreshes, a notification is placed in the title of the sequence diagram view (Refreshing... for english). Again, the user is free to do other things while it is refreshing. As soon as the diagram is ready, it is displayed, and the notification is removed from the view title.

Still no AJDT features can be accessed. I get the same results.I happened to have an M5 archive and tried that.  Installed okay, got thewelcome page, but ""new project -> aspectj"" complained of a wizard prob, andclicking on the AspectJ line in the preferences area did nothing.Alas! On M6, I cannot even go to ""new project -> aspectj"" that option isnot available.Also, in the preferences area I do not have an aspectj line. Unfortunately, AJDT 1.1.4 works only with Eclipse 3M4 or earlier.To work with Eclipse 3M8, AJDT 1.1.7 is required, which will be available soon.Eclipse versions between 3M4 and 3M8 are not supported. AJDT 1.1.7 has been released which works on Eclipse 3.0M8 and the AJDT download page on the website has been updated to correctly reflect which AJDT versions work with which Eclipse versions.I hope anyone waiting on Eclipse 3.0 support will be OK with M8 support rather than M6 support. 1.1.7 release works on M8, we skipped the intermediate eclipse M releases as the base is changing quickly.

I've put some initial work on this.Now there is a ""Show in CView"" but it does notdrill down to ICElement ... yet.Need some more work from the model/parser etc ...No ETA.In is in the head, it is base on some initial patchprovided by Thomas Fletcher that I rejected last year. I am supplying to CView's selectReveal operation ICElements and it opens up ok (as long as the view was previously expanded so that it is fully populated - another defect).The reason it is critical is that we have an alternate view of the ICElement and we want the user to be able to locate to it within the C/C++ projects view.  I can accomplish this using CView's selectReveal operation.  However CView is an internal class and we are not supposed to ship using internal classes. I would prefer an action but would be happy with an alternate non-internal class which provides the same functionality.Thanks > The reason it is critical is that we have an alternate view of the ICElement > and we want the user to be able to locate to it within the C/C++ projects > view.Sure, we can work something out.

50631	Hook for resource scheduling rule factory	I20040121I have released new API that allows clients to ask for the scheduling rule forvarious operations (copy, move, delete, validateEdit, setContents, etc).  Manyof these rule requirements actually vary based on the repository provider (forexample CVS needs to lock the parent folder for most operations).  Core needs toexpose something in the TeamHook to allow repository providers to provide a rulefactory. See bug 46753 for more detailed discussion. Increasing priority. This must happen for 3.0 or all non-CVS team providers willbe stuck with the hard-coded rules we are specifying for validateEdit, etc. I suspect bug 57668 occurred because a 2.1 provider (ClearCase) obtained the workspace lock in the vaidate Edit callback. It's unfortunate but I think we need to make the default rule for validate edit the workspace to ensure that 2.1 pessimistic providers still work in 3.0. We would also need to make sure that 3.0 providers override the rule with a rule of lower granularity. I agree that workspace root will have to be the default rule when a non-3.0provider is installed on a project. I am worried now that people upstream may bemaking hard-coded assumptions about what locks are acquired in core methods.  Ineed to get this done soon so we can iron out the bugs. <Pyinson Data Over Head> Yes, this will be fixed in a way that allows for backward compatibility forolder team providers.  Priority P1 means we won't ship Eclipse 3.0 without it. I have released new methods on TeamHook to allow repository providers to changethe scheduling rules used for all workspace modifying operations.  The TeamHookthen needs to delegate this down to the RepositoryProvider API.Moving to Team component for remaining implementation work. *** Bug 57675 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** *** Bug 58593 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** I have released the changes for Team and CVS.

50325	PDE classpath container not working with importing binary projects (SWT fragments)	"3.0 M6I downloaded 3.0 M6 today (to do some quick coding for draw2d and gef) and created a fresh install including workspace.Steps to repeat:1. new workspace ""C:\eclipse-develop-3.0\plugins"" (autobuild is still on)2. import external features ""org.eclipse.jdt"" and ""org.eclipse.platform""3. import external plug-ins and fragments contained in these features as binary projects (66 of 80)4. checkout ""org.eclipse.draw2d"" and ""org.eclipse.gef"" from CVS HEAD (they are using pde container)Although ""org.eclipse.swt"" is in dependency list of ""org.eclipse.draw2d"" the plug-in doesn't compile and shows errors that imports ""org.eclipse.swt..."" can not be found.Updating classpath for draw2d plug-in with context menu ""PDE Tools -> Update Classpath..."" doesn't fix the problem. You need hack the binary project (fragment) ""org.eclipse.swt.win32"" to export its jar and add this to the classpath manually to resolve the compile errors. After rersolving this new compile errors complain about missing ""org.eclipse.core.runtime.Platform"" and ""org.eclipse.core.runtime.IPluginDescriptor"" classes. As per the Porting guide, for pre-M6 plug-ins to compile against a >= M6 build, you need to add ""org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility"" to the dependency list of the plug-in. Sure, but org.eclipse.draw2d and gef arn't pre M6 plug-ins any more (current CVS HEAD).However, I don't see a relation of adding plugin ""org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility"" to the dependency list and solving missing ""org.eclipse.swt*"" classes which are neither exported by the binary swt plugin nor by the binary swt.win32 fragment.""org.eclipse.draw2d"" and ""org.eclipse.gef"" can only depend on ""org.eclipse.swt"". Due to the first steps I have imported ""org.eclipse.swt"" plug-in and ""org.eclipse.swt.win32"" fragment as a binary projects. So why do I get the compile errors complaining about missing ""org.eclipse.swt*"" classes? didn't suggest that org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility was behind the swt problem.  The suggestion was to address the last portion of your problem.  Need to investigate the swt thing, and that is why I left the bug report open. oh, thanks Another problem I experienced which might be related to the classpath problems with binary projects.- fresh workspace- I imported all installed plugins belonging to org.eclipse.platform feature as binary projects.- I checked out several org.eclipse.cdt plugins from HEAD (which already contain updated references to ""org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility"" and no reference to ""org.eclipse.core.runtime"" any more)==> ""org.eclipse.cdt.core"" cannot resolve ""IProgressMonitor"" which is in ""org.eclipse.core.runtime"" but ""org.eclipse.core.runtime"" is not reexported in my workspace from ""org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility"" although it is marked for reexport. I can update classpathes with ""PDE Tools --> Update Classpath"" several time but the problem still exists.It seems that there are some major problems with the PDE classpath container and binary plugin projects. I had very similar problems with source projects --possibly the cause was the same -- in my case theyturned out to be caused by an incomplete .classpathin org.eclipse.swt, which listed only two of the manysource folders. It happened after I had deleted.classpath and then used PDE Tools:Update Classpath,but I may have done something else as well; now if Idelete, then update, I get the correct .classpath back. Using M7, I did all the steps in the original bug report epilogue and all the steps in comment #5, and everything worked like a charm.By the way, classpath containers are the only way to compute a classpath by PDE as of M7, and have absolutely nothing to do with how you import.As for comment #6, it is unrelated to this bug report.  But it seems that org.eclipse.swt was checked out from CVS.  The swt team has a special setup for this project, the project comes with many .classpath_* files, one per platform.  After checking out, you need to rename the .classpath_* file that is suitable to your environment to "".classpath"".  This is a must if you check out swt from cvs.  If you import swt using PDE's external plug-ins wizard, PDE will then set up your classpath correctly.

Just to confirm: are you saying that you replaced only the JAR file, or thewhole plugin contents (plugin manifest, and other files)? I suspect that this is some contention between differnet methods of timestamp checking.  When this happens what is the status of the bundle in question?  (run with -console and type 'ss' at the osgi> prompt.  Look for your bundle.  It will be INSTALLED, RESOLVED or ACTIVE or not there) Rafael, you're right, I replaced the whole plugin contents.Jeff, I always run with -console, but I don't see an osgi> prompt. Where should I find it? Press a couple of time ""enter"" and this should bring you one.In case where nothing is being displayed, still in the command and validate. Pressing Enter several times has no effect either. Jerome, are you sure you are not only specifying -consolelog (instead of -console)? In Eclipse, we always had -consolelog. This option causes the log to be outputto the text-based window. Since M6, a -console option enables a prompt where youcan enter commands against the OSGi framework (I know they are confusing). BTW,you may specify both at the same time. Thanks Rafael. I was indeed confused with -consolelog. I'll give it a try and report back.

There were two lines in the old code (InternalPlatform.setupMetaArea) that did this://try infer the device if there isn't one (windows)if (location.getDevice()==null)	location = new Path(location.toFile().getAbsolutePath());It looks like this code was lost in the refactoring to support platforms without a data area.  If you don't do this, and you specify a ""-data"" area without a device, then there are many places where location comparisons fail to match because sometimes there is a device and sometimes there isn't. This sequence needs to be added back, in some central place when the location is being initialized, to be sure that it always has a device. Fixed in HEAD.

50597	Enhancement request: need drawGlyph API in draw2d.Graphics	"Now we are requesting SWT team to expose drawGlyph() API to the public.When it is available, could you add an API wrapping it to draw2d.Graphics? Absolutely.  Please mark this bugzilla as depending on the SWT feature request and we'll get notified when it is available. Thank you very much.  This is necessary for bidirectional language support. Saitoh-san,I didn't understand the entire discussions in bug 6782 and the newer bidi layout bug.  But, it looks like the work is still in progress, even though your bug is ""resolved"".We will definitely add the glyph support immediately when SWT exposes it.  Of course I may not realize when they expose it, so feel free to update this bugzilla.Also, GEF definitely needs to support WYSIWYG text editing similar to page designer.  We should work together after 3.0/6.0 to understand BiDi, since that is the main reason GEF has not tried to support text editing.Thanks! Each Arabic character has four possible glyphs depending on the context.For drawString() API, only the text being drawn can be the context.  However there are cases we can not pass the appropriate text as the context.  For examaple, if we draw 'he' in blue and draw 'llo' in red, we will call drawString() twice, one for 'he' in blue and another for 'llo' in red.  While we should pass the whole word 'hello' as the context, we can not do it.  As the result, we will have the wrong glyphs for 'e' and 'l.'To avoid this, we want to separate retrieving glyphs from drawing them.  SWT's BidiUtil has APIs for them though it is in an internal package.  This is why we have requested them to expose BidiUtil to the public via Bug6782. But they may implement similar APIs in TextLayout class, which is a public class they are still working on, instead of exposing the BidiUtil.  Either way is okay for us as long as the APIs are public.  Anyway, I will inform you if they finish their work.I am very happy to work with you to understand Bidi. > For examaple, if we draw 'he' in blue and draw 'llo' in red, we will calldrawString() twice, one for 'he' in blue and another for 'llo' in red.  While weshould pass the whole word 'hello' as the context, we can not do it.  As theresult, we will have the wrong glyphs for 'e' and 'l.'What you could probably do is paint the entire ""hello"" twice - once in blue,then in red, and just *clip* the 'he' area for the first paint, and the 'llo'area for the second. Thank you very much for your suggestion.  I agree that it works fine for the example I wrote but I have other motivations to request drawGlyph().While drawString() reorders the characters automatically but it must not be done in some cases.We will already have the glyph information when drawing the text because the information is needed for the calculation of caret postion and layout.

18797	Evaluation that hits breakpoint confuses debugging	"Jdk1.4.1_b11Source will be attachedSet breakpoints on lines 21 and 39Debug to a breakpoint at line 21From the editor, display, ""this.hitBreakpoint()""you hit the breakpoint at line 39, but the thread still claims to be evaluating, no indication of the breakpointHit Run to ReturnYou are back at line 21, but the thread still claims to be stepping, and the stepping actions are not enabled.Click resume and things are back to normal. Created attachment 1184Sample.java source Reproduced with simpler test case.When we hit a breakpoint while evaluating, the thread shows as ""Evaluating"" because the thread still knows that it's in an evaluation. I'm not sure this is really a problem, as this feedback (""You're suspended inside an evaluation"") may be more useful than the standard breakpoint feedback.The broken state after the Step Return appears to be a timing problem, as the bug goes away when debugging. When I hit a breakpoint during an eval, and press resume, things work as expected. However, when I do a step over at the breakpoint in the evaluation, things work badly - the UI hangs for about 20 seconds, and the thread state is confused. Marking as F4 candidate I have debugged it a little, using the following test case (using JUnit):(1) Place a breakpoint on the first line of VectorTest.testCapacity() [line 32](2) Place a breakpoint in TestCase.toString() [line 193](3) Launch VectorTest(4) Hit first breakpoint in ""testCapacity()"".(5) In the display view, evaluate ""this.toString()""(6) hit second breakpoint (druing evaluation)(7) Press step overAt this point the evaluation completes. The evaluation has the correct result, but the UI blocks for 20 seconds waiting for the details to be computed (which fails). However, the problem is that when I press ""step over"" in the middle of an evaluation, the evaluation should not complete - it should step. ARCH team approval: The consequence of not fixing this is that the debugger behaves poorly when a breakpoint is hit during a user evaluation, and a user performs stepping at that breakpoint. The UI can hang for 20 seconds, and a debug session can become corrupt (the debug model state is no longer in synch with the running target). There are two problem in this case. First, the call of the toString() method on the result of the evaluation is donealmost synchronously in the UI thread. If this method takes time to be evaluateor if there is a probleme during the evaluation, the UI blocks until the end ofthe evaluation or the timeout. The asyncexec call should be delayed until thestring result is computed.The second problem looks like a Sun VM problem. After the step over, the valueof the toString() call is returned, as if the evaluation was completed. But thestop stack frame is not correct, the thread seems to be stop in theString.toString() method. And the VM does not answer when we try to evaluate toString() on the result of the evaluation.The problem occurs with Sun VM 1.3.1 and 1.4.1 b02 b10 b11.The same test case has the right behaviour with the J9 VM.I cannot reproduce the problem with jdb.Need more investigation on this problem. Needs more investigation. Removing as F4 candidate until we have complete fix. Comment from JaredB:This is a total mess. We should disable breakpoints during all evaluations for 2.0. We've observed that the following series of events is occurring:VM            Debugger  --BP event-->  <--invoke start--  --BP event-->  <--step start--  --invoke end-->  <--invoke start-- (eval toString())  --step end--> (stop in toString()) This appears to be a VM problem, but our code isn't helping the situation - there's a VM bug here, but we can avoid it.The fix is for JDIThread#invokeComplete() to call JDIThread#abortStep(). This way we delete the pending step request when an invoke completes, thus avoiding the Sun VM bug.This also fixes our problem with J9 in this scenario, since J9 doesn't send us a StepEnd notification when a step results in an invoke completion. Previously, if you stepped out of a suspended evaluation on J9, our stepping buttons never reenabled because we never got the StepEnd we were waiting for. Aborting the step solves this problem. ARCH approval: The consequence of not fixing this is that our debug model can be come ""out of synch"" with its corresponding target. A user may end up killing a debug session becuase of this. The fix is straight forward, but the frequency of a user running into this problem is not known. The problem only occurrs when you step out of an evaluation. Stepping within an evalution and resuming to complete the evalaution works as is. Note: with this fix, the ""UI hang"" does not occurr. The hang was occuring, because the ""step end"" event received after the evaluation completed caused the target VM to suspend, thus preventing the ""toString"" evaluation to complete.

The not optimal UI and a new feature request for fine grained control for Javadoc errors. I opened A separate bug for the UI issue (bug 48066). Regarding the fine grained control for Javadoc. Currently when reporting errors in Javadoc is switch on all errors in all Javadocs are reported. So if there is a wrong Javadoc for a private method it is flag as an error.More fine grained control needs support from JDT/Core. Fixed.See bug 46854 for more details...

50547	MessageBox locks out application	"The following scenario causes SWT to lock under SWT for windows. A parent shellX is created and opened. Then, a text entry dialog Y (a child of the X) isopened titled ""X"". In this scenario, given the nature of the dialog, it is ofstyle APPLICATION_MODAL. At some point while Y is open, the application mustpresent an important error message. So, a MessageBox Z, also a child of X (or Y,same effect) is created and opened titled ""Z"". MessageBox Z will of course stayon top within the application which is intended. However, the taskbar at thebottom (under win2k) will list windows ""X"" and ""Z"". If you select ""X"" at thebottom, it will put windows X and Y on top and beep at any mouse or key click.Clicking ""Z"" at the bottom does not redraw Z back on top and the screen remainswith X and Z displayed. Because the user must click okay in the message box (andis prevented from doing so, this effectively locks out the application forcing amanual termination to exit the program. Based on my testing this seems to bebecause the SWT thread is locked in a wait until the MessageBox (Z) is exited,so any redraw or other SWT requests are postponed indefinitely. As a side note, this assumes that shell X is larger and entirely overlaps Z asif it does not, the user can still activate Z by seleting the titlebar via themouse.  Regardless, trying to switch it via taskbar (which is the only option ifX overlaps Z) fails. It seems strange that clicking Z in the taskbar does not bring it back on top of X.  Snippet:public static void main (String [] args) {	Display display = new Display ();	final Shell x = new Shell (display);	x.setBounds(10,10,800,800);	x.setText(""X"");	Shell y = new Shell (x, SWT.APPLICATION_MODAL | SWT.DIALOG_TRIM);	y.setText(""Y"");	y.setBounds(200,200,200,200);	Text text = new Text (y, SWT.SINGLE);	text.setBounds(10,10,50,30);	text.addListener(SWT.KeyDown,new Listener() {		public void handleEvent(Event event) {			MessageBox z = new MessageBox(x);			z.setText(""Z"");			z.setMessage(""you typed something"");			z.open();		}	});	x.open ();	y.open ();	while (!x.isDisposed ()) {		if (!display.readAndDispatch ()) display.sleep ();	}	display.dispose ();} This seems to work better on XP.  You can eventually get the MessageBox back.  The problem is that there is no standard for modal behavior on Windows.  SWT disables shells and this seems to interfere with the MessageBox's idea of modal.The problem doesn't seem to happen when SWT shells are used:public class PR_50547 {public static void main (String [] args) {		 final Display display = new Display ();		 final Shell x = new Shell (display);		 x.setBounds(10,10,800,800);		 x.setText(""X"");		 Shell y = new Shell (x, SWT.APPLICATION_MODAL | SWT.DIALOG_TRIM);		 y.setText(""Y"");		 y.setBounds(200,200,200,200);		 Text text = new Text (y, SWT.SINGLE);		 text.setBounds(10,10,50,30);		 text.addListener(SWT.KeyDown,new Listener() {		 		 public void handleEvent(Event event) {//		 		 		 MessageBox z = new MessageBox(x);		 		 		 Shell z = new Shell(x, SWT.SHELL_TRIM | SWT.APPLICATION_MODAL);		 		 		 z.setText(""Z"");		 		 		 z.pack();//		 		 		 z.setMessage(""you typed something"");		 		 		 z.open();						 while (!z.isDisposed ()) {						 		 if (!display.readAndDispatch ()) display.sleep ();						 }		 		 }		 });		 x.open ();		 y.open ();		 while (!x.isDisposed ()) {		 		 if (!display.readAndDispatch ()) display.sleep ();		 }		 display.dispose ();}} Fixed > 20040130NOTE: It is not possible to get the MessageBox to come to the front.

I think that I am experiencing similar problems with M7.  When I set the src and bin directories to be the project itself, PDE doesn't find the binaries.  I'd really appreciate a work around for this, it is causing us all kinds of headaches.Thanks.James Jeff, did anything change in Core in M7 that would cause this? what does PDE put on the -dev arg when the binary output is in the root of the project?  -dev .?I do not think that things changed in this area. Jeff: Thanks for your reply - where can I find the ""-dev"" arg? Right-click on the process in the Debug view and select Properties to see the command line args.Jeff, similarly, nothing changed on the PDE side with respect to -dev xxx for months now. Wassim - Thanks.Only ""bin"" is getting added to ""-dev"".  I am running a number of plug-ins which together form an RCP.  In all other cases the binaries are in bin.  So it seems that ""."" should be added but isn't.  How would I go about introducing this manually? For the record, PDE has never put '.' on the classpath.You could manipulate the argument to -dev directly in the Classpath Entries field on the Arguments tab.  It takes a comma-separated list. Adding ""."" to the -dev path worked.  Thanks for your suggestion Wassim.  I'm interested to know why this doesn't happen automatically when the project is the root of the bin directory.  Wouldn't that be the expected behaviour? We play by Jeff's rules (because we know what's good for us ;-)  There has never been a mention of putting '.' on the classpath. I don't think that we ever said ""don't put . on the classpath"".  The challenge is that doing -dev . will put . on EVERYONE's classpath.  This is less than optimal and may lead to weird side effects. I recall that we had a plan to make a more sophisticated mechanism that would allow PDE to express its classpath mods.  something like a properties file where the keys were plugin ""identifiers"" and the value the appropriate dev time classpath entries.  so for example, _default=binorg.foo.plugin=binorg.bar.plugin=.,otherDir,some.jarThis is cool and we can do this as an alternative form for -dev     eclipse -dev @dev.propertiesor some suchWe need to discuss the exact form of the keys.

10526	[Decorators] Decorator mechanism does not allow for optimizations	At present our decorators show up piecemeal because we do them in a background thread and thus the order they appear is 'random'.The way we decorator mechanism works does not allow us to optimize in some areas.  Specificly:1. The icon and text are asked for separately. This requires us to go to our sync info twice, which is on disk and expensive to get.2. The decorators are asked individually.  In the case of CVS, all the sync info for sibling resources is in the same file, so its faster for us to determine all their decorators at once.3. In order to avoid doing work in the UI thread, we create a background thread to generate the decorators.  When then need to tell the UI via an event that we now have decorators, and then they ask us for them.  It would be better if we could just give the UI the decorators we know about all at once.Note: to be a good citizen we should be computing the decorators in a thread different than the UI context.The combination of #2 and #3 could result in the decorators appearing in parent child ordering, with all siblings appearing at once. Investigate for M5. We are investigating a solution for 1.For 2, we discussed this yesterday and it seems like this is no longer problematic for VCM.For 3, as mentioned yesterday, we need to come back and ask for the decoration again in order to apply decorations in the correct order.As for the order of appearance, I will be looking a TreeViewer update and may change it to process items in pre-order rather than top-down There is a solution for 1 in build 20020402. We now also allow for a LabelProviderChangedEvent to take multiple items so the number of requests for decoration will now be reduced dramtically.

50448	Unable to load class (exception in Bundle.loadBundleActivator)	"<Pyinson Data Over Head> This bug was also reported on the mailing list by two other people:http://dev.eclipse.org/newslists/news.eclipse.platform/msg12130.htmlhttp://dev.eclipse.org/newslists/news.eclipse.platform/msg12208.html Here is another message in the mailing list about this problem:  http://dev.eclipse.org/newslists/news.eclipse.platform/msg11621.htmlFrom this posting:  The problem I guess was that I did not had default empty  constructor. When extending my plugin from AbstractUIPlugin  I had to provide one. But this create incompatability with  AbstractUIPlugin (it has only one implicit constructor  AbstractUIPlugin(IPluginDescriptor descriptor)). It is not  possible just set it to ""null"" in super() call because  you'll fail on assertion. I guess it is possible to mock it,  but I didn't go further. Instead I just extended my plugin  from Plugin class.  If I derrive my Plugin from org.eclipse.core.runtime.Plugin instead of org.eclipse.ui.plugin.AbstractUIPlugin, and add an empty constructor!!, I have no problem.I tryed to remove the dependency on org.eclipse.osgi from the plugin.xml, but (for some reasons, I don't understand), I cannot. If I do so, I the the following error:   The project was not built since its build path is incomplete.   Cannot find the class file for org.osgi.framework.BundleActivator.   Fix the build path then try rebuilding this project.I have no idea what generates this dependeny.... As a point of interest, are you writing your own manifest.mf or are you putting the runtime related mark up in the plugin.xml?  The question I really want to ask is ""what is you bundle activator class"" OK, all I do is to try to port some 2.1.2 plugins to 3.0. Therefore I use theplugin.xml. I have no knowledge of OSGI (except I know in principle what it is)and I am not using it currently (so, no manifest.mf). I was surprized thateclipse forces me to depend on the osgi plugin. I thought that osgi would beinvisible to me.... Can you outline the steps you took to ""port"" your plugin?  That is, what tools if any did you use, etc.I ask because all of Eclipse and other products run with no changes and no knowledge of OSGi.  I suspect that something has been upset during your porting process.  either that or you have a usecase that is new to us and is not correctly handled.You certainly should not not have to know about OSGi unless you want to. The same happens to me when I deploy our plugins targetted originally at Eclipse2.1.2 into the 3.0M6 version. The upper part of the stacktrace is exactly thesame, although in our case, the exception gets thrown during adding a nature toproject's description.I have done no porting as far as I can tell.I have two dependent plugins: ...schema.core and ...schema.ui (ui depends oncore). The UI plugin activates fine, and can show a Wizard. When the Wizardattempts to add nature ID to the project description (nature is registered bythe core plugin), this exception is thrown.The ui plugin declares proper dependency on core (and works fine on Eclipse 2.1.2) I just got the same error when I tried to execute an action from the relengplug-in using I20040203. Adding      <import plugin=""org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility"" optional=""true""/>to the required plug-ins section fixed the problem. Here is what it seems to be happening: plug-ins not having a <?eclipseversion=""3.0""?> tag or requiring org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility areconsidered old-style plugins, that need more complete support for backwardscompatibility. The plugin class for new plugins must have a no-arg constructor(as BundleActivators do). The plugin class for old plugins must have aconstructor taking a IPluginDescriptor.It also happens that currently PDE generates plugin manifests that are tagged as3.0 but have an old style plug-in class (which inherits from AbstractUIPlugin) -I just opened a PR to handle this issue: bug 51206. For completeness: the instantiation exception happens because (as pointed out incomnment 3) the plugin class constructor does not match its plugin style. >the plugin class constructor does not match its plugin style.Can you comment a bit more on that. The plug-in has:	/**	 * The constructor.	 */	public RelEngPlugin(IPluginDescriptor descriptor) {What's wrong with that? Most Eclipse plug-ins have this and only this constructor.Note: The plug-in has <?eclipse version=""3.0""?> tag Also note: there must be some changes in recent builds (meaning in the last 1 or2 weeks) which changed in that area since we could use the releng plug-in beforewithout problems. A 3.0 plug-in that is not in backward compatibility mode (from the viewpoint ofruntime/OSGi) has a plugin class whose constructor takes no arguments (yours isan example of one that requires 2.1 style support from runtime). Currently, a plugin is consided ""new style"" if it has the <?eclipseversion=""3.0""?> processing instruction *and* does not requireorg.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility.Your problem is that your original manifest was for a ""new style"" plugin,although your plugin class has a 2.1 style constructor (expectingIPluginDescriptor). Requiring org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility tellsruntime that your plug-in is a 2.1 style plug-in (again, from the runtime pointof view - the ""eclipse"" processing instruction has a broader meaning).Pascal, Jeff, comments? Thanks for the info. I filed bug 51239 against Platform Releng which own thetool. It surprised my because it did not strike me when OSGi came into life butwith a recent build. Keeping the PR open so Jeff/Pascal can confirm the observed behavior is what isexpected (I don't think this is documented anywhere yet). the Plugin class has to have the default constructor IF it is used as the Bundle-Activator.  The default transformation of the plugin.xml to manifest.mf puts a standard backward compatibility bundle activator in the manifest.mf as the activator and lists the Plugin class in another header.  when the compatibility activator is run, it looks at this other header and creates/invokes the plugin class as normal.Pascal put in some code recently which was supposed to make this more backward compatible but we may have gotten it wrong.  I;ll try to find pascal and ask about it.  Marking as M7 P1 Hmmm... so it seems bug 51206 is invalid... Please advise as to whether it makes sense to provide a 0-arg constructor in AbstractUIPlugin. AbstractUIPlugin must provide a 0-arg constructor to allow real bundles to inherits from AbstractUIPlugin.I think this fixis already in. Just for clarity, let's summarize the different behavior that are / should be supported.1 - Unconverted 2.1 plugin. The bundle activator will be the default activator provided by runtime (PluginActivator) and the plugin-class specified in the plugin.xml will be used.2 - Plugin.xml containing eclipse 3.0 tag, and requirements containing org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility. The bundle activator will be the default activator provided by runtime (PluginActivator) and the plugin-class specified in the plugin.xml will be used.2 - Plugin.xml containing eclipse 3.0 tag, the requires DO NOT contain a reference to org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility. The plugin-class specified in the plugin.xml will be used as a BundleActivator which requires the plugin-class to have a 0-arg constructor, as well as all the classes in its hierarchy.This last use case depicts a situation where people really want to take advantage of the new OSGi runtime. Decreasing priority since the issue is understood. Michael, could you try if you can still reproduce the problem with one of today's I-Build? I still have the same problem :-( Could you provide the plugin.xml and your plugin class (or at least all the signatures) Created attachment 8001Simple plugin that demonstrates the problemHi...I just hit this.	I'm on M7.At first I thought that M7 just didn't have the AbstractUIPlugin with theno-arg constructor, but I checked and it's there.   So I tried adding a no-argconstructor into my plugin and it worked!:public xxx () {super();}I whipped up a simple testcase for this by taking the Hello World PDE sampleand taking the runtime compatibility off of the class path and putting the 3.0runtime on.  If you try to use the Sample Menu you get ""Operation notavailable..."", but if you add the no-arg constructor it will work.   I suppose it could be a ClassLoader problem, but I've tried on IBM JRE 1.4.1and and early version of IBM JRE 1.4.2, so I would suspect it's somewhere inthe OSGI layer.Thanks... *** Bug 52799 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** Note, there likely was a problem in M6 but it has long since been fixed.As for the current behaviour, we don't believe it to be a problem (compatibility or otherwise). Comment 19 describes exactly what is going on.  The first thing to note is that 2.1 plugins continue to work unchanged.Next, plugins marked as <?eclipse version=3.0?> and requiring runtime.compatibility also continue to work unchanged.It is only if you are wanting to get off the compatibility layer (why?) that you actually need to change your plugin class to have the zero arg constructor.Note that if your plugin class is exposed as API for others to subclass then they cannot get off compatibility until you do as there has to be a zero arg constructor all the way up the hierarchy.Closing. I didn't do anything as malicious as removing the compatibility from the classpath when I first hit this (that was only to reproduce the problem).  I believe that all I did was open my 2.1 plugin in the PDE, and hit PDE Tools -> Migrate to 3.0 and then my plugin wouldn't load when I tried to run it.  If the Migrate to 3.0 Tool does add the compatibility to the classpath, then I suppose it's possible I had some other errors in my workspace that prevented my manifest from being properly updated. I can't judge in how far this is relevant, but I can give a counter-example of the statement ""The first thing to note is that 2.1 plugins continue to work unchanged."" in comment #26.  I'm using together-for-eclipse 6.2 (also tried 6.1) and I used to get similar errors as in other comments in this bug report. Today, I tried Feb. 26's integration build, and I can't even seem to install it anymore. (Before, some together views did work)..   Anyway, if 2.1 plugin compatability is a real goal for eclipse 3, it seems to me it hasn't been achieved yet. However, if it isn't a goal (and I understand it may be impossible to achieve 100% compatability), maybe there should be a kind of warning at startup.

48692	Decoration process is very slow	When I disconnect, refresh, and then reshare my project, the decorationprocess takes a very long time.  I have ~3000 files in one directory and itseems to process these at a rate slow enough that I can see each file name crawlby.  It has been decorating this directory for the past 13 minutes.  This is on a p42.4 with 1gig ram.  I am running nothing else cpu intensive.related to bug 48691 Ended up taking a total of 15 minutes. I am unable to reproduce, here is what I tried:PS: enable decorators, and tested with navoigator and java packages explorer open1. created a project with two directories eahc containing 5000 files2. shared the project and added all the files3. decorations occured within 5-8 seconds for all files.I then shutdown and restarted, expanding the directories in the nav and javaexplorer. It seemed reponsive, and far from your 15 minutes.I have a p4 2GH with 1GB ram.If you can get a stack trace at the tijme you think it is decorating that wouldhelp. It may be something else slowing you down. Or provide and end-to-endscenario that reproduces the problem. Thanks. I am not sure what you mean by shutdown and restarted but what you should betrying is team->disconnect and then refresh and then team->share.  Do not deletecvs meta data.There is no stack trace output at least not in the log file.  I have tried thismany times and it is always reproducable with the same time lag.When you have the progress tab open and the decoration tree expanded can youread the file names as they scroll by?  My project has a total of 40700 files in 9000 directories. Just in the off chance that this problem is related to another bug, did you delete any files outside of Eclipse and perform a Refresh before decoration occurred? I didn't delete any files outside of eclipse but i did do a refresh.  My process was:have a project with 40700 files in 9000 directories in cvs.team->disconnect and then refresh and then team->share.I think the performance problems have been reduced in e3m7,  I'll give it a tryand see how long it takes. Still appears to be just as slow on the 1500 xml files in the one directory. When I look at the progress I can see each file name go by.  Is it doing a diff of each one versus the repository?  Or is it doing a checksum.  Seems like it is taking too long to be a checksum.Could it not just check the cvs metadata that already exists for those files andsee if the size of the file has changed?  Granted that isn't going to give you100% confidence that the file didn't change but it should give you at least 99%.And the changes that you would miss would typically be a 1 character change.Maybe default to the pessimistic diff decorator behavior but have a setting toenable the above?  I know I'd use it.Sometimes I have to disconnect because directories have been deleted from theserver and the amount of time this takes is enormous.  So far I have been waiting 21 minutes for this process to complete. Final time was 24 minutes.  Project stats are now 55,000 files in 9900directories.  From watching the process though it seems to spend the majority ofthe time on the 3000 xml files, taking about 1 second per file.  Perhaps thereis just a problem with xml file comparison? There are only a few things that happen during decoration. One is the loading of the sync info from disk. We have fixed some bugs post-M7 that caused us to load the sync info each time a file was decorated instead of loading it once for the folder (this is why I asked about the external deletions). The other is the loading and comparison of the timestamp of the file to the one in the sync info which should be fairly fast. Also, once resources are decorated once, we cache a bit of info to improve deep decoration. You could try one of the latst integration builds to see if the latest integration builds have improved anything. We'll be makign a perfomance pass at some point and will be sure to test a similar scenario. Will verify for M8. I didn't get to this in M8, but marking as high priority for M9. If we are doing something stupid we should figure it out now. WE are running with YourKit now so taking a perf snapshot is a piece of cake. *** Bug 44025 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** I've tested again and profiled. I can't see any slowness on our part. We'vefixed some decorator performance issues pre-M8 regarding how the packages viewcan apply quikc label updates and this may of helped. Again, if you see thishappening please grab a stack trace, or a couple, when you think it is takingtoo long decorating. This will help debug any other problems. PS: you can grab a stack trace on windows by running with -consoleLog and thenCTRL+BREAK in the console to get the trace. 	2010-02-07 02:41:33	1265530000.0	resolved fixed	e34b164	1291390000.0	java/org/apache/catalina/connector/Connector.java java/org/apache/catalina/connector/Request.java test/org/apache/catalina/connector/TestRequest.java

By the way, if you are placing children each in a special content pane, then why don't you implement reorder children to do ""nothing""?  The figure's don't even have the same parent, so their order doesn't mean anything.So, your implementation should be just fix the list of children:  children.remove(editpart);  children.add(index, editpart); 1. ""By the way, if you are placing children each in a special content pane"" - No, we can have multiple figures in each content pane.2. My work around is simply to catch the exception:protected void reorderChild(EditPart child, int index) {  try {    super.reorderChild(child, index);  }  catch (IllegalArgumentException iae) {    IFigure childFigure = cep.getFigure();    LayoutManager layout = getContentPane().getLayoutManager();    Object constraint = layout == null	? null	: layout.getConstraint(childFigure);    getContentPaneFor(child).setConstraint(childFigure,constraint);  }} There are possible other places where a single content pane is assumed. Are you unioning together multiple relationships in your model?  The preferred way to support two sets of children, like methods and attributes, is to either:a) implement another ""children"" collection in your editpart.  For example, add ""children2"", contentPane2, etc.b) insert grouping editparts.  For example:ClassEditPart  AttributesEditPart(group)    AttributePart    AttributePart  MethodsEditPArt(group)    MethodPart    MethodPArtThe user cannot select the grouping editpart and in fact does not know they exist.We will make the change in 3.0.

48837	[workspace] Fails building plugin JARs with multiple source folders	We have several plugin projects where we use source folders to organize our code.  It is not uncommon to have a plugin with five source folders each of which is built into a seperate runtime JAR.  This setup compiles fine and runs just fine but the PDE build is failing.  It fails because our source folders depend upon each other and PDE requires that a dependent JAR be built first.  The problem is that since they depend on each other, it doesn't matter which order we put the JARs in the build.properties file, it will always fail.An example is a plugin with three runtime libraries mapped to three source folders A, B, and C where A depends on B and C and C depends on A. Looking into the problem more I see that the output folder for the project (bin) is added to the javac classpath for all runtime libraries except for the first one.  So, only the first runtime library cannot have references to the others.  The first library should also have the bin folder on its classpath. This is being supported by the property jars.compile.order.Take a look at org.eclipse.osgi for an example I looked at org.eclipse.osgi and I don't see how this solves the problem.  This plugin just provides a compile order.  In our plugin, the libraries have cyclical loops among them.  So there is not an order that would compile.My example has a plugin with libraries a.jar, b.jar and c.jar and a.jar depends on both b.jar and c.jar.  Also, b.jar depends on a.jar and c.jar depends on a.jar.If you saw my last post you would see that the first library is not getting the output folder added to the classpath.  This is incorrect.  All libraries should have the output folder on their classpath. I missed the circular dependency.This is not supported and there is no plan to support it in an immediate future.This makes the creation of the jars more complicated because all the classesmust be compiled at once and therefore all the .class files will be produced inthe same result folder.The compilation done, the script would have to find all the files that were in agiven source folder, find all the resulting .class files and put them into a jar.If you have such a dependency, which benefits does the multiple jar brings you?Can't you factorize the circularity into one folder? This won't be fix for 3.0. Marking as enhancement.

50207	Compile errors fixed by 'refresh' do not reset problem list or package explorer error states	"When you have a project that also references external jars, there appears to be a problem with error tagging.Consider the following example:I have a project that has some code that references external jars.In the first instance, there were missing methods in classes in the external jars, so the compile failed. The open editor displayed the errors, as did the Package Explorer and the Problems view.I replaced the external jar with one that fixed the errors, and did a Project 'refresh' from the package explorer.The rebuild occurred and, in the open editor, all indications of the error state disappeared.However, the Problems view still displays all of the original compilation problems (now resolved), and the Package Explorer still has a red 'x' next to the class and package that had the problems.Doing a ""rebuild all"" correctly resets the state of the Package Explorer and Problems view.It would seem that the build done by the 'refresh' does not clear the error states in the views before performing the compilation. NB This was observed with build N200401150010, but I couldn't say it was restricted to just that version Feels like no build is actually occurring since no resource got touched (only external JARs).

50184	Reworking of Error Log Properties Dialog	  The current dialog is not as user-centric for navigating through a set of log events as it can be. It is currently modal and specific to the selected event.  This means the user has to dbl-click on the desired event, it opens, the user closes it and moves on to the next event.  There is nothing wrong with this functionally but it means we can't keep error details up while flipping through the code to find out where we went wrong since we can't click anywhere else on the screen whilst the dialog is up.  It also means there is a great deal of opening and closing of the dialog since we have to dbl-click on the error to view its properties.Thus, the proposal is on the table for the following improvements:User Interface --------------1. have navigation buttons for scrolling through events2. have a function button to copy the properties of the selected event3. rework UI so that session data, stack trace, and other event details can be seen on one page rather than having to flip to another property pageUsability & Functionality --------------1. make the dialog modeless2. when the dialog is up, we should be able to click on any other event and the dialog will be repopulated (otherwise, a dbl-click summons the dialog)3. when the dialog is up, we should still be able to reorder columns at which the navigation buttons will adjust accordingly4. navigation is between siblings (i.e. if we open the dialog to a subentry, the Next button will go to the following subentry under the same parent or go to the following parent if it is the last subentry under its parent.  If we open the dialog to a parent entry, the Next button will go to the following subentry regardless of if it has children or not.)5. Copy function will put error type, date/time, message, and stack trace into clipboard as usual.

50168	[state] Unresolved bundle should appear as warning in the log	"When the state is resolved, all unresolved bundles should be listed in the log. This will ease debugging. We need also to report the reason why a bundle has not been resolved.Something that we need badly is a way of reporting problems from inside theframework and having them surfaced in the Eclipse log. Eclipse 2.1 (or 3.0before M6) used to print messages like that to the console when in debug mode,although this is not the ideal solution. See bug 49505, for instance. Fixed in HEAD. For each bundle added and not successfully resolved, if debug isenabled (-debug), a corresponding message (""Bundle XXX could not be resolved"")will be printed to the error stream. A more complete message can be produced ifthe following debug option is enabled:org.eclipse.osgi/eclipseadaptor/debug/platformadmin/resolver *** Bug 49505 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** Real fix should be: print error messages to the console when in debug mode, butalways log it. I now see this message in my console for no reason. Please handle the casedescribed in bug 50878. The reason why the message appears in your case is because, temporarily, thoseplug-ins could not be resolved (but later they are). I agree that it is confusing.I will change it to be: before starting the runnable responsible for startingthe application, check if there are any unresolved bundles. If there are, logthem (printing to System.err until we have a logging facility in the OSGi level- see blocking bug 47592).This has a caveat (some may call it a feature): a warning will be logged everytime Eclipse is started (and not only when resolution happens).

50127	[KeyBindings][MenuMgmt] Quick fix (Command+Q) quits Eclipse immediately on Mac	"The keyboard shortcut for Quick Fix is Command-E Command-Q, command q is the quit command so trying to invoke quick fix causes the app to quit. I tried to reassign the key but the UI for the keyboard shortcuts in preferences is messed up on the mac (filed under another bug #50126).Version - 3.0M6There is nothing in my .log file. doug, while this is mac specific - i can't fix - it is purely something for you to sort out with SWT.the mac has an application menu which binds command+Q, command+H, etc. before we get them. coincidentally, this is also a menu management bug - we need a mechanism from SWT to hook some of these menu items (preferences, about box, quit, etc). we definitely need to hook quit, the user needs the opportunity to save their files.not only do we need to be able to hook the menu items, it would be nice if we got these keypresses first as well (and could draw in the accelerator area of this menu).i think the hook (for the quit case) is critical for 3.0 (if the mac was an official platform, i'd even say blocker) andre probably knows some duplicates of this bug.. Yes, Command-Q is hooked by Carbon before we get it. But I think this is true for certain shortcuts on all platforms and we cannot (and shouldn't) work around it.So using Command-Q as a default key binding for something not related to Quit is a problem on Mac (but easy to fix).However, Command-Q is handled correctly by SWT and Eclipse. It generates a Quit Application Event that is translated into firing an SWT.Close event from the Display. The workbench hooks this event and shuts down Eclipse gracefully. Try yourself: press Command-Q if you have a dirty editor. You will be asked and you are able to veto. The only problem we have is that SWT disposes the Display after sending out the SWT.Close event. And this is too early for some code in the workbench. But this problem is not Mac specific and happens on other platforms too: try to log out on window if Eclipse is open.BTW, the Mac is an official platform, but we don't have a ""blocking"" problem with a Quit-hook.We should only get rid of the Command-Q for Quick Fix. The new key configuration has been removed, so this bug isn't as important right now.  Unless this is bound in the default key configuration, but on Mac only?  The problem goes through normal shutdown, and so is not ""critical"", per se.  As Andre mentions, this is the same as ""Alt+F4"" on Windows or GNOME.  I also agree with Andre that it is not wise to override this behaviour.  On GNOME and Windows at least, ""Alt+F4"" starts a timer -- if the application doesn't respond in timer, then the user is given the opportunity to kill the application.  Overriding this behaviour could conceivably nix a useful window manager function.  The problem is really a conflict in the new key configuration.  It was a mistake to bind ""Command+Q"" in a multiple-stroke key binding.  As much as it would have been a mistake to bind ""Alt+F4"" in multiple-stroke key binding on another system.  Since this is a problem with the new key configuration -- which may or may not ever come to fruitition -- I'm moving this bug to LATER.   Moving duplicate resolved (but not fixed) bugs to verified for M8.  As of now 'LATER' and 'REMIND' resolutions are no longer supported.Please reopen this bug if it is still valid for you.

49426	Layouts should support laying out only a subset of a composite's children	"Currently all standard SWT layout managers always lay out all children of thecomposite they are managing. This includes children which are not visible. Whilethis may be desired in some cases, it makes it difficult to manage dynamiclayouts where the layout should change when a control is made visible or invisible.The SWT layout managers should allow the programmer to specify a subset of themanaged controls for which a layout will be computed. I initially thought ofhaving a ""hideInvisibleControls"" flag on all layout managers but that would notbe sufficient. When hiding a control you could redo the layout and get theexpected results but when showing a control, you first need to recompute thelayout to make room for the control and then make the control visible after thelayout has changed. If you were restricted to computing a layout for visiblecontrols, you would first have to make the control visible, thus showing it witha wrong position and size, and then recompute the layout.So instead of such a flag I am proposing a ""public Control[] controls"" field forall layout managers where you can explicitly set the controls which will beconsidered for computing the layout. If this field is set to null (which shouldbe the default), the composite will be queried for all children (the currentbehaviour). Simply replacing all calls to ""composite.getChildren()"" by ""controls== null ? composite.getChildren() : controls"" in all layout managers should dothe trick.I have done these modifications to my own copies of the SWT layout managers(where I simply copied the original code; this cannot be done throughinheritance because the calls to composite.getChildren() are not encapsulated ina protected method of the Layout class). So far I have tested the modifiedversions of FillLayout and FormLayout and they worked as expected. I have been thinking about this problem as well.  Off the top of my head, the *right* SWT way to do it would be for the layout data of every layout to have an ""ignore"" flag to filter children from the list.  This would mean that when application code called setVisible(), it would need to update the ""ignore"" flag and then call layout().The ""public Control [] controls"" field is an interesting possibility as well and would require fewer code changes.Neither seems very good.  Have you considered either disposing and recreating your controls or using FormLayout?  Using FormLayout, it should be possible to hide a control and make sure that no other controls are attached to it and the layout().Seems to me we need some simple example code that we can experiment with to capture the kinds of things that applications are trying to do. Another possibility is to open up Layout by removing the ""finals"" and making all of our Layout classess go through something like ""protected Control [] getChildren (Composite composite)"".  This would allow you to subclass and filter the list of Controls before they were passed to the layout algorithm.  This kind of solution opens things up a bit but means that every application must subclass and filter which is bad. Created attachment 7337My modified versions of the standard SWT layout classes I've also thought about a protected getChildren() method. It's actually part ofmy current implementation. I've inserted an abstract class DynamicLayout betweenLayout and the concrete *Layout classes. DynamicLayout provides getChildren()(or getComponents(), as I named it) which is used by the subclasses. From mypoint of view, it doesn't matter much if the layouts provide getChildren() or apublic field to set the children. I suppose I could make use of a ""ignore""property in the layout data in a similar way.What does make my work easier is a common interface for these features (providedby the DynamicLayout class in my implementation), but not having one wouldn't bea big problem either. I need separate factories for each layout anyway if I wantto support them in my XML GUI framework. They could use anonymous subclasses ofthe respective *Layout class. (I've come across several other cases of identicalfeatures with identical methods in classes without a common interface in SWT,but that would be a different bug report. :-)I've created an attachment with my modified layout classes. Here's some XMLmarkup (slightly modified and abbreviated from one of my working examples) whichshows the kind of layout I'm using. You should have no trouble reading it sincethe component and layout names and features translate almost 1:1 to SWT features:<Window>  <layout type=""form"" margin=""0.7em"" spacing=""0.7em"" hide-invisible=""true"" />  <TextBox id=""c2"">    <layout-data t.pos=""0%"" l.pos=""0%"" r.pos=""100%"" width=""25em"" />  </TextBox>  <ToggleButton text=""Show details"" id=""c6"">    <layout-data t.id=""c2"" r.pos=""100%"" />  </ToggleButton>  <Composite>    <layout-data t.id=""c6"" l.pos=""0%"" r.pos=""100%"" b.pos=""100%"" />    <layout type=""form"" spacing=""0.7em"" />    <Separator id=""sep"" orientation=""horizontal"">      <layout-data t.pos=""0%"" l.pos=""0%"" r.pos=""100%"" />    </Separator>    <Label id=""p"" text=""Select a previous class name:"">      <layout-data t.id=""sep"" l.pos=""0%"" r.pos=""100%"" />    </Label>    <List>      <layout-data height=""8em"" t.id=""p"" l.pos=""0%"" r.pos=""100%"" b.pos=""100%"" />    </List>  </Composite>	</Window>In this example, the underlying models toggle the visibility of the Compositewidget when the state of the ToggleButton changes.I'll try to come up with a snippet to demonstrate this. So far, all my GUIs arein XML which makes converting them to snippets a lengthy process :-/I thought about disposing and creating the widgets as needed, but this couldpossibly be a complex and lengthy operation. The GUI shown in the XML code aboveis quite simple with only one widget to be hidden (though it's a Composite, soyou'd need to dispose and create the children as well) and that widget is thelast child of its parent. If I wanted to support that in XML, I'd either have topresent this feature in a more complex and limited way (with a differentnotation) or use the above notation and possibly need to dispose and recreatethe entire contents of a shell when the first widget (instead of the last one)is shown or hidden. I really don't like either of these two variants, especiallysince it is so much easier to do with layout managers. When faced with thesealternatives only, I'd rather keep my current implementation.I have not yet thought about allowing dynamic layouts for FormLayout only. If Iunderstand you corrently, I'd have to modify the FormData and/or FormAttachmentobjects when I show or hide a control, so that controls would only haveconnections to other controls when they are shown. Is that correct?What happens to the unconnected controls? Are they simply ignored or put intothe top left corner (or somewhere else)? If they end up in a default locationthey could still influence (read: ""destroy"") the layout if they are too big.I'll try this and see how it works. FormLayout is easy to use for dynamic layout. Here is one little simple example, but there are many ways you could do it. Using FormLayout in this way works fine, and when a control is not visible, it does not take up space in the parent.import org.eclipse.swt.*;import org.eclipse.swt.widgets.*;import org.eclipse.swt.layout.*;import org.eclipse.swt.events.*;public class Main {	static Display display;	static Shell shell;	static Button button;	static Text text;	static FormData showText, hideText;		public static void main (String [] args) {		display = new Display ();		shell = new Shell (display);		shell.setLayout (new FormLayout ());		button = new Button (shell, SWT.PUSH);		button.setText (""Details >>"");		button.setLayoutData (new FormData ());		button.addSelectionListener(new SelectionAdapter() {			public void widgetSelected(SelectionEvent e) {				if (text.getLayoutData() == hideText)					text.setLayoutData (showText);				else					text.setLayoutData (hideText);				shell.pack ();			}		});		text = new Text (shell, SWT.BORDER);		text.setText (""Hello, details!"");		showText = new FormData ();		showText.width = 200;		showText.height = 100;		showText.top = new FormAttachment (button, 0, SWT.DEFAULT);		hideText = new FormData ();		hideText.left = new FormAttachment (0, 0);		hideText.right = new FormAttachment (0, 0);		hideText.top = new FormAttachment (0, 0);		hideText.bottom = new FormAttachment (0, 0);		text.setLayoutData (hideText);		shell.pack ();		shell.open ();		while (!shell.isDisposed ()) {			if (!display.readAndDispatch ())				display.sleep ();		}		display.dispose ();	}} Carolyn, thanks for the snippet. This certainly looks like a good alternative tomy layout modifications, at least for FormLayout (which is the most importantlayout manager, anyway). Unless a new method is introduced which can be usedwith all layouts, I'll modify my framework to use this method for FormLayout.Here's a modified version of the snippet which uses my layout classes (containedin the attachment I posted yesterday):import org.eclipse.swt.*;import org.eclipse.swt.widgets.*;import com.novocode.naf.swt.layout.*;import org.eclipse.swt.events.*;public class DynamicLayout2 {  static Text text;    public static void main (String [] args) {    final Display display = new Display ();    final Shell shell = new Shell (display);    final DynamicFormLayout layout = new DynamicFormLayout ();    shell.setLayout (layout);    Button button = new Button (shell, SWT.PUSH);    button.setText (""Details >>"");    button.setLayoutData (new DynamicFormData ());    button.addSelectionListener(new SelectionAdapter() {      public void widgetSelected(SelectionEvent e) {        if (text.getVisible()) {          text.setVisible(false);          layout.controls = DynamicLayout.getVisibleChildren(shell);        }        else {          layout.controls = DynamicLayout.getVisibleChildrenPlusOne(shell, text);          text.setVisible(true);        }        shell.pack ();      }    });    text = new Text (shell, SWT.BORDER);    text.setText (""Hello, details!"");    text.setVisible(false);    DynamicFormData textData = new DynamicFormData ();    textData.width = 200;    textData.height = 100;    textData.top = new DynamicFormAttachment (button, 0, SWT.DEFAULT);    text.setLayoutData (textData);        layout.controls = DynamicFormLayout.getVisibleChildren(shell);        shell.pack ();    shell.open ();    while (!shell.isDisposed ()) {      if (!display.readAndDispatch ())        display.sleep ();    }    display.dispose ();  }} For now, the answer is to just use FormLayout.  This is still a problem for the other layouts but I'm not really happy with any of the proposed solutions so far. Subclassing just for this feature sounds like overkill.  Filtering the controls might prevent a layout from working.  For example, if a hidden control is connected to some of the visible controls in FormLayout, then that layout might need access to even hidden children.I favor adding:setObserveVisiblity(boolean)boolean getObservingVisibility()to LayoutJavaDoc would indicate that this is a hint to the layout manager. Actually we were going to add a field to the layout data.  Although it would be possible to put it in Layout, subclasses would suddenly get new ""free"" API that offered services that they wouldn't know they needed to implement (and thus wouldn't). It seems like all that would be needed is a single boolean value per composite. Using layout data requires more work, and I don't know of another use case for ""don't layout this child"".  Some layout don't require layout data at all currently. Added the field ""exclude"" to RowData and GridData.  Ido not currently see how it would make sense for FormData so I have not added it.After changing the layout data field to true, you must set the visibility of the associated widget and cause the layout to be invoked.e.g.GridData data = (GridData)control.getLayoutData();data.exclude = true;control.setVisible(false);shell.layout(false); (In reply to comment #11)I know this is an old bug, but to me the recommendation> Added the field ""exclude"" to RowData and GridData.> GridData data = (GridData)control.getLayoutData();> data.exclude = true;> control.setVisible(false);> shell.layout(false);seems to be a workaround and not a satisfying solution.Would it be an option to add a new property to GridLayout like preserveHiddenElements(boolean) that is set to true by default. When set to false we could omit getting the GridData of each child, setting the exclude flag and so on. I guess this would not break compatibility but make life easier for developers. What is it that you are trying to do? If you send me a screen snapshot and a description of what you need to do, then we can try to write a snippet to do it using the current API.And please open a new bug for this, and reference this old bug.

GLA does not generate error messages for missing/invalid/empty log files. if the log file is empty it shouldn't generate an error message.  It just won't give any output, or will continue to monitor the file when it is in continuous mode.  As for the missing/invalid file, isn't this something you added just recently Paul? Based on Richard's comments, the use cases where the log file is empty or missing are currently covered.  The final use case to be handles by this defect is when the log file is an invalid log file.  Invalid log files may include incorrect types (e.g. attempting to parse an access log using the error log adapter rules), incorrect log record(s) and/or corrupted text in the log file. The third use case will be handled in the UI when importing log files.

49987	"[EditorMgmt] Typo in IPageLayout.ID_EDITOR_AREA = ""org.eclipse.ui.editorss"""	"Someone asked me if they could add a few to a perspective relative to the editor area instead of another view. I believe the answer should be yes, they just have to refer to the area by name in their plugin.xml. However, looking at the source code, the editor area name is defined by the constant IPageLayout.ID_EDITOR_AREA which has the value ""org.eclipse.ui.editorss"". This looks like a typo so it probably shouldn't be documented this way and it should be changed. Changing it would probably break binary compatibility but I think you can just add a check to test for both the right and wrong values in IPageLayout.addView() and any similar functions to support plug-ins using the old value.

Trying to shutdown leads to a ""Workspace is locked"" error dialog, and Eclipsedoes not exit normally (i.e., it leaves behind the "".metadata/.lock"" file).The start of the craziness appears to be:""org.eclipse.core.internal.dtree.ObjectNotFoundException: Tree element/org.eclipse.ui.workbench.texteditor/bin not found.""So, two questions come out of this:1.) Is it really necessary to fail with such a workspace?2.) If a failure occurs with such a workspace, why is the "".lock"" file leftbehind on shutdown?  (i.e., if the workspace can't be read, should the user beallowed to reconstruct a new one -- rather than needing to manually delete theold one on disk?)My workspace has been zipped up, and is available for inspection.

But I still think the UI should have tooltips that describe the icon and the annotation in the overview ruler. Especially in the overview ruler, color is the only indication what an annotation stands for, and a new or color-blind user has no idea that e.g. blue means incoming.

If we provide buttons similar to those shown in the attachement, with appropriate hovers it will be clear what each colour stands for. Still, the user would have to do the mapping via colors. Is there a special reason why you don't want to add the expected tooltips? Normally, all UI elements (except for labels) have a tooltip, so I don't see why this should be different here. Additional description in the Help is always good, but it does not replace the standard tooltips on buttons and button-like elements. 	2010-09-10 19:35:43	1284160000.0	resolved fixed	5eb3851	1285950000.0	java/org/apache/catalina/core/StandardServer.java

On my machine, the scroll bar moves, but the controls in theTable do not.2) Tabbing all the way to the end of the visible table and beyond does notscroll the table as expected.  Instead, the cursor goes off into la la land. Pressing shift-tab repeatedly brings it back eventually.  However, the cursornever should disappear when it is being manipulated through the keyboard. - To run the snippet I removed the ""if (i == 25) text25a = text;"" line.- 1) This seems wrong.- 2) After tabbing off the end of the table, focus goes to the ""3"" and ""50"" buttons, then back to the top of the table.

This means that the underlying table has no idea that it contains TableEditors.When you call setTopIndex(), this eventually causes the scroll bar to scroll by making some interal operating system call that does not invoke listeners.  This is the correct SWT behavior but means that the TableEditors don't move.I hacked the example to move them.When you tab to a Table, the table has no idea that you don't mean focus to go to it but would perfer focus to go to a child. There are situations where you might want this behavior but it looks funny in the example.  I hacked the example to assign focus.I'm not going to close this PR because these are valid problems in the design of TableEditor, but not strictly bugs.  I'm going to assign it to Veronika who owns the class. *** Bug 46210 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** Duong, there are many problems that are encountered in TableEditor because it is a decoration.

49730	[source lookup] Call stack editor annotation ambiguous	"Build: 3.0 M6If I have two threads suspended with the same method somewhere in their callstack, I cannot distinguish between the two because both are highlighted in thesame way in the editor. I would expect only the call stack of the selectedthread to be displayed in the editor (not the stacks of all threads). Created attachment 7380JPG showing multiple callstack pointers This does look odd. We currently show annotations for any stack frame that gets selected. We clear the annotations when the associated thread is resumed/terminated. Needs some thought. Deferred. *** Bug 89713 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** This problem also happens across IDebugTargets:1) Enter a Hello World program with this main here:                public static void main(String[] args) {                                 System.out.println(""Hello"");                                 System.out.println(""World"");                }2) Put a breakpoint in each System.out line3) Launch in Debug mode. When it hits the 1st breakpoint, click STEPOVER just once4) Launch it again in Debug mode again. Now you have 2 targets of thesame program, each target suspended on a different line.5) Now as you flip the selection of Debug Target in the debugger, youwill see that the editor will have 2 arrows in the editor, regardless ofthe selected stack frame. It is confusing, as the user has no clue inwhich line he really is in that particular debug target. Created attachment 29177screenshot of problem across 2 IDebugTargets I have this same problem in my own scripting language in Eclipse. So, I would like to see this fixed.I noticed that as I switch between IDebugTargets in the debugger, my IDebugModelPresentation.removeAnnotations and IDebugModelPresentation.addAnnotations are not called, which is probably why we end up with 2 markers on the same editor regardless of the IDebugTarget selected?

50021	Double-click and quick fix annotations	Build: I20040106I was annoyed by the fact that warning annotations hid my breakpoints, and bythe fact that double-clicking in the vertical rule to add/remove a breakpointalso caused the quick-fix shell to pop up.  So, I removed the warning annotation from the vertical ruler from the javaeditor preference page.However, even after removing the annotation from the ruler, double-clicking on aline that contains a warning still causes the quick fix shell to open.  It seemsthat the action associated with that annotation should not happen when theannotation is turned off. You run into another bug: quick fix light bulb was hidden by magnet. This is nowfixed and you would see the quick fix light bulb. To disable quick fix ondouble-click simply turn this off (Java > Work in Progress).

50018	update class path  should prompt to save the plugin.xml	"If you edit build.xml and then do update class path you are not prompted to save the build.xml file. This can make things very confusing (and anything which improves the comprehension of plugin classpath juggling is a good thing)Ideally this classpath update should happen automatically of course I meant plugin.xml not build.xml Not sure what build you are using, but the classpath will update automatically upon saving the manifest file if you are using PDE's dynamic classpath.If you are using <= 3.0M6, then when you update the classpath, check the 'Use dynamic classpath' option.If you are using > 3.0M6, dynamic classpaths is the only way, so all you need to do is update it once, and it will reupdate your classpaths whenever the plugin.xml changes. the point i was making was that IF you change and  DONT save the plugin.xml file (and I have the habit if never saving anything since the platform will do it for me all the time) then the PDE tools > Update classpath MUST prompt you to save the manifest. If that menu option is going away then this bug can be ignored The menu option is not going away.You say that the ""update classpath"" should happen automatically.  PDE does it upon resource modification (e.g. saving).  Anything more ""automatic"" than that would be undesirable and would result in an influx of bug reports complaining that PDE should just back off.Prompting the user to save when updating the classpath is something to consider though. Janek, this is an easy polish defect.Make sure we prompt to save dirty files when the user selects PDE Tools > Update classpath via the context menu of a plugin project or a manifest file.

49195	DCR: New SelectionTool with support for panning	Create a new SelectionTool subclass.  I want it to behave exactly like the existing selection tool, with the following additions:- When selection tool is in its initial state, if it receives the SPACE keydown, it will switch to a PAN state- While in the PAN (or PAN_IN_PROGRESS) state, a hand cursor will appear- If I mouse down in the pan state, I will transition to a PAN_IN_PROGRESS state which allows scrolling the viewport by pressing and dragging the mouse.- When leaving the state PAN_IN_PROGRESS, return to either the PAN state or the STATE_INITIAL based on whether the SPACE bar is still depressed.Use the obvious name choices for constants, not exactly what I've used.Pratik to review changes before releasing. Added PanningTool, PanningToolEntry.LogicEditor uses PanningTool by default. Default EditDomain still uses SelectionTool. Don't forget to set the target milestone.One more change, when pressing CTRL+SPACE, the panning mode should not be activated.  CTRL+SPACE is accessibility method for toggling selection of focused part. Classes have been renamed PanningSelectionTool & PanningSelectionToolEntry.

This also seems to be a problem on Linux and Linux-Motif.It seems to be caused by using pkzip or other zip tool to create the archive,causing links to be destroyed. Chris is this still a problem with the latest builds?Moving to Platform/Releng for comment. I don't understanding what is happening here since eclipse does not ship with a vm.   the last comment is correct.  That is  the problem.  The java command just calls .java_wrapper and .java_wrapper looks at $0 to decide what command to look for in /usr/bin.

49726	[Workbench] Weird Java perspective icon in action bar	"See attachment.Version: 3.0.0 Build id: 200401070010 GTK buildSteps to reproduce:New workspace.Clicking on the ""Open a Perspective"" button will show the regular icon.Once I've opened the perspective the checkmark icon will be shown after clickingon the ""Open a Perspective"" button again. Created attachment 7379showing the checkmark icon This one also affects the Java Browsing Perspective icon.I think it has something to do with the way the drop down is populated.Only the Java Perspective and Java Browsing Perspective icons will be replacedw/ the checkmark icon though. Created attachment 7386this is how it looks on windows - everything okThe difference is that the Java/Java Browsing Perspectives uses a context menuwith checkboxes. This menu is controlled by Platform/UI. Asking for comments. BTW, which GTK are you running?Is it also a problem in the Window > Open Perspective menu?The reason the menu works differently in the different perspectives is due to bug 49857.  The current perspective should always be included in the list, with an accompanying bullet.  I don't think this is JDT-specific.  They just happen to add shortcuts to their own perspectives.I suspect the problem here is due to a GTK bug which uses the regular image area to show the bullet for a selected radio item.  A second problem is that it's showing a check mark instead of a bullet for SWT.RADIO style.This may be caused by the fact that the Workbench is using a mix of push items(SWT.PUSH) and radio items (SWT.RADIO) in this menu.  It should probably always use SWT.RADIO style and just set the selection appropriately.  See PerspectiveMenu.createMenuItem. Looks like a GTK bug.  Felipe to look at it quickly, see if we are doing something silly or we can work around it. On gtk, radio and check menu items do not support images, that is why you don'tsee the icon in the pop-up menu. The 'weird icon' you see is the check mark ofthe checked menu item. This is a platform limitation. Closing this bug as WONT FIX  Checked it out myself :{ For SWT.RADIO style, is there any way to get a bullet icon rather than a checkmark? How important it is ?Here the reason we use check instead of radio:case SWT.RADIO:	/*	* This code is intentionally commented.  Because GTK	* enforces radio behavior in a button group a radio group	* is not created for each set of contiguous buttons, each	* radio button will not draw unpressed.  The fix is to use	* toggle buttons instead.	*///	handle = OS.gtk_radio_menu_item_new_with_label (0, buffer);//	break;case SWT.CHECK:	handle = OS.gtk_check_menu_item_new_with_label (buffer);	break; From and end-user point of view, it's pretty bogus to be using checkmarks instead of bullets.  It's an important cue to indicate that the choice is 1 of N rather N independent yes/no choices.

49613	[JUnit] JUnit - Run Test for Class	"If I just want to test a single unit of the application, I do not want to lookfor the corresponding test case. I thought that selecting the class in thepackage explorer should bring up the option ""Run JUnit Test for Class"". Thecorresponding test is then looked up and run automatically.The same could be implemented for a set of classes or a package. The interesting question here is: how do you find the corresponding test class. This needs some meta information. You are right, there has to be some meta-information. If there is no suchinformation, assumptions could be made:By default the test class should reside in the same package and have a similar name.  com.xyz.Class => com.xyz.ClassTest (for the test class)  com.xyz.*     => com.xyz.TestSuite (for the package) ... sorry no better ideaThe pattern may be configurable like the prefix and suffix list on the codegeneration preferences (Prefs > Java > Code Generation > Names) in order to suitproject standards and requirements.For the lookup to work, a separate source folder for tests (see bug 49611) wouldbe quite convenient. That would impede looking up non-test classes in the firstplace. This request is quite complicated to implement. We put a lot of effort to not show the 'Run as JUnit' launch shortcut until we know it's a test.

49128	API to get access to a IColorManager implementation	For the WSADIE tooling, we have an expression editor which uses a java-like syntax. We would like to reuse the color define by the java editor (for strings, keywords, other).I found the public interface IJavaColorConstants and IColorManager. But I could not find an API to get access to an implementation of IColorManager. The only thing I could find was JavaPlugin.getDefault().getJavaTextTools().getColorManager(). But JavaPlugin is an internal class.Is there some API I did not see to accomplish this? If not, could one be added? Just adjusting the version to 2.1.1 (I've not looked at 3.0 code to see if there is such an API - if there is, great!) You can create your own instance of JavaTextTools.

Will use unformatted text instead. kind: 8, string: package p;;class A{} Formatter is JDT/Core. Moving... I will investigate. The code formatter has to ""consume"" the empty type declarations (thesemi-colon). This is a useless semicolon, but it has to be handled by the codeformatter.Working on a fix. Ok, I got a fix, but I think I should also add new options to format these emptytype declarations in a more flexible way.Do you want to be able to configure that an empty type declaration is on the newline or not and the number of new lines between type declarations? I will add these two options.Then when you use the next integration build, you can tell me if they work asyou expect. Sounds right althought I thought you said you would consume these empty type declarations. Perhaps you should add an option to remove empty statements/type declartions etc. You are right. This could be a good option. I will add it.To be consistent with the way we treated the empty class body declaration(semicolon among class members), I will simply add an option about the number oflines between type declarations, but the empty type declaration will be leftbehind the closing brace of the previous type declaration or on its own line ifthe preceeding type declaration ends with a line comment or is missing.If in the future, we want to add an option about the positionning of those emptytype declarations, I will add it. I am afraid it could become too messy if weadd too many options for no good reason.Is this ok for you? I am not sure I followed but if you add the option I mentioned in comment #6 I am happy! Here is what I will do to fix this PR:1) Add an option to remove useless empty statements, empty class body declarations and empty type declarations.2) When you want to preserve them, they will simply put at the end of the previous type declarations.And I will also add a PR for an option to specify the number of blank line between two type declarations.Hopefully I am clear this time :-). crystal...thank you very much!

49550	[CellEditors] Need StyledTextCellEditor	"GEF needs to support editing of word-wrapped strings using CellEditors.  We tried using TextCellEditor with MULTI | WRAP style bits.  It is problematic due to its limitations on win32.Our workaround is to use StyledText. Therefore, we need a StyledTextCellEditor.We can provide the test case and implementation if needed. Could you summarize the problem with Text using MULTI | WRAP on win32, or point to an existing PR for the problem?If going with StyledText is the only answer, then having you contribute a StyledTextCellEditor would be good. We are trying to grow a Text as you type into it.  The use case is editing a ""sticky"" note.  The sticky note has a fixed width determined by the user, and its height is automatically adjusted to fit the string.The problem with Text is that it prohibits text entry once the text completely occupies the widget.  We tried enabling scrollbars, but the behavior was still not correct, and the scrollbars would always be disabled so they were just ugly. The operating system must be doing something similar somewhere.  Can you point to a place?  Thanks. For example, on the windows desktop, when you edit the filename for a file.  Whatever control is used there, it will grow when the text flows over to a new line.  Text(MULTI | WRAP) doesn't do that because it prevents the user from typing the overflowed character. Try the latest.  The Windows feature in the native widget should be worked around. Reassigning bugs in component areas that are changing ownership.

Same applies to .SVN folders if your using subversion. You probably should be able to configure eclipse to tell it what files to ignore. The CVS folders are hidden but there are some known problems. How did you populate your workspace from CVS? Did you use an external tool to checkout the CVS projects and them import them? This is currently the only known case that postentially results in visible CVS folders. Could you provide us with the steps you took to get the failure so we can determine if yours differs? source populated using standalone CVS client (Tortoise CVS) connecting to my CVS server which is CVSNT.

49476	AspectJ weaver API is not threadsafe	I am using the weaver API (mostly BcelWorld and BcelWeaer) in a multithreadedenvironment and ran into problems. I tracked them down to some static variablesin the BCEL library implementation that can cause exceptions in the weaver(signatures are not parsed correctly) when executed via mulitiple threads. Maybethe weaver implementation can use the BCEL library in a threadsafe way to allowmultiple threads working with the weaver API. This would be a great contribution. Contributing a simple solution seems to be somewhat difficult in this situation.I solved this problem in my usecase by creating a lock on my transformer object(that uses the AspectJ weaver API). This might not be a suitable solution forthe AspectJ code. Therefore I am not sure how to solve this problem in anelegant way.Let me describe the problem in more detail. Maybe someone else has an idea howto solve it for the AspectJ code base itself.The problem is the BCEL class org.apache.bcel.classfile.Utility. It uses astatic field named consumed_chars in several methods. This static field ischanged as a side effect by some methods and causes therefore trouble if morethan one thread is using this class. Therefore the best way to solve thisproblem is to patch this class, I think. But maybe we do not want to change anexternal library.I tried to find out what code of the AspectJ weaver implementation accesses(indirectly) the Utility class. This seems to be a quite complicated task. I wasnot able to solve this within an adequate time.In my use case (the multithreaded problems) the Utility class of the BCELlibrary is used as a result of org.aspectj.weaver.bcel.LazyMethodGen.pack().Therefore it would be possible to create a static lock in this class to avoidmultithreaded usage of the BCEL library. But I am not sure whether this is theonly point where this problems can occur. The same problem occurs in the BCEL class org.apache.bcel.generic.Type, whensomeone calls getType (same static field consumed_chars). Created attachment 8380patch of Utility and Type classI changed the implementation of the BCEL classes Utility and Type so that theyno longer use the static field consumed_chars. The modified versions of bothclasses are inside the attached zip.I tried the BcelWeaverModuleTests suite with this (runs fine). I also triedthis patch with my load-time weaving implementation for the new osgi runtime ofEclipse (where I observed the multithreading problems) and that code runs fine,too. It seems to me that the multithreading problems are solved. Created attachment 8381simple test cases for Utility and TypeI wrote some very simple test cases for both classes to get a feeling if theystill behave as before my patch. They don't yet test multithreading problems,because I have no clear idea how to test this stuff in a predictable way. I just recognized that the next version of BCEL will also fix this issue. Thecurrent CVS head stream of BCEL does include a patch for the multithreadingissues. So you can take the current BCEL cvs version of both classes or my patchto fix this bug. Does that help ?In old AW, we were using Bcel and had to fix it that way:http://blogs.codehaus.org/people/avasseur/archives/000101_bcel_internal.htmlhttp://blogs.codehaus.org/people/avasseur/archives/000106_bcel_patch_submitted.htmlI don't know if it ended up in a bcel release or the one embedded in AJ sincethat time but might be worth looking at ? The current CVS head version of BCEL does include your patch (or at leastsomething similar). I am using the HEAD version of both source codes in myload-time weaving runtime to enable multithreading and it works fine. Thereforeseems to be a good thing to integrate these patches into the BCEL version AJ isusing from my point of view. Created attachment 18398Patch to make BCEL threadsafeI adapted the fixes that are in the current BCEL cvs head for the BCEL versionthat is currently used for AspectJ. The changed files are attached to this bug.This makes my old self-implemented fixes for older version obsolete. I have modified BCEL to remove the reliance on static info in those offendingclasses.  I didn't use the patch directly as I wasn't sure about the use ofthreadlocal so I rewrote the offending methods (the methods really just wantedto return multiple values, so I used a holder object and return that instead). I've added a few tests to the bcel-builder project to test I didn't regress thefunctionality but they don't verify the weaver is now threadsafe.  However,Martin has tried my changes and confirmed it works in his environment.  I'llclose the bug when a build is available. marked as AJ5 M2...

49443	[External Tools] Add the ability to associate an external tool with an extension	"It would be nice to allow one to run an external tool whenever a file with acertain extension, or pattern, is modified.  This is useful when it's not reallyworth writing an editor for some particular type of file, but it must still becompiled or processed in some manner.  I would imagine the UI to be similar tothat of the ""File Associations"" preferences page, except that multiple externaltools could be specified, with order being significant.The particular use case that I have is developing applications for the Hiptopplatform (http://www.danger.com/).  The Hiptop folks have defined a file of type.rsrc (resource), which is a fairly simple text file.  I would like the abilityto launch the Danger Resource Compiler external tool that I have definedwhenever I save the file in the default text editor.  Currently I must do itmanually, which is a little clunky and error-prone.  I could (and perhaps Iwill) make a plugin that is specifically meant to edit that type of file, but inthe meantime, it would be nice to have the aforementioned tool-launching ability.It may be that this functionality already exists somewhere; but I cannot find itif it does. :) Is this really a Contributions issue? this is external tools request.. nick, do you know where this belongs? External Tools requests should go in the Platform-Ant component for now.You can configure an external tool builder on the project properties page.I don't believe you can currently get it to only activate for specific file types though.  You would need to filter it down yourself, e.g. with an Ant script. The closest functionality we have currently is to create an External tool builder that would be triggered on modification of a working set of your .rsrc files. See the Build Options tab for the builder to specify the working set it is triggered on. Deferred to post 3.0 The functionality that is described in comment #4 is all that is planned. As of now 'LATER' and 'REMIND' resolutions are no longer supported.Please reopen this bug if it is still valid for you.

49445	outline and ant runner views should  include imported targets	"In handling an imported file (using the <import> task), the outline and antrunner views should behave similarly as when entity includeds are used. The difficulty in implementing this, I am guessing, is that imports are probablyresolved at runtime rather than at parse time. A build file author might,perhaps, use a property dereference to in the <import file=""""/> declaration. Toaccomediate this an action in the views could prompt the user with a dialogallowing him to associate the import with a specific file in the file system.This configuration detail could be saved in a comment in the build file itselfor else in some other configuration store.Of course, we could handle direct file references now and code for propertydereferences in the import's file attribute later. I am having trouble visualizing how this would show in the outline (I can see it in the Ant View).The outline represents the structure of the Ant build file. Would we still show the import task? Would the targets be children of the import task? Would the targets have a label indicating that they came from an import? Imported targets and macrodefs could be decorated with a label decorator. The tool tip could indicate from which file the target was imported. The import task should still be shown in the outline. We'd want a filter button in the view toolbar to turn this off--in fact it should probably not be the default.Note that while it is not particularly good practice to do so, one may import a build file which has top-level tasks. I believe that these tasks are also imported along with targets and macrodefs. (Macrodef is actually implemented as a task).See http://ant.apache.org/manual/CoreTasks/import.html for additional information regarding what happens during an import. Particularly of interest are the 'Target overriding' and 'Special properties' sections. I have released a first pass at this for the outline.I need to do more testing and possibly some polish but feedback is appreciated.Changes to AntEditor, AntElementNode, AntImportNode, AntModelMessages, AntPropertyNode, AntTaskNode, IAntModelConstants, AntModel and ProjectHelper. This appears to work very well. I tested a number of bizarre senarios and couldn't break it. The outline even reflects recursive imports. Furthermore, both the outline and code assist works as expected renaming targets in overrides, adding the extra property so that the path to each imported file is available, etc.IMHO only two issues need work:#1. Add icon label decorators for imported targets (I can look at this if you'd like.)#2. Reconciliation needs to take into account that I may have made changes to an imported file. Currently I have to cut and paste import statements for the new targets to appear in the outline view. Note that support for this should be recursive as well.I am surprised at how well this functionality appears to perform. Admittedly My tests are with small build files, but the performance impact was imperceptible. If performance continues to be good on with 100k files, I'd recommend this should be the default functionality. A tool bar option could turn it off. To be very friendly to large build file authors one could even check file size before opening it and if it is above a threshold, we could turn it off automatically. (If this last suggestion has merit and more general applicability I could open a bug: 'optimize for very large build files'.) Created attachment 8232added overlay decorator imported elements Created attachment 8233overlay image for import elementsPlace this icon at: \org.eclipse.ant.ui\icons\full\ovr16\import_co.gif I was wrong about #2. As soon as any change is made to the buildfile all of theimports are re-reconciled and changes to the imported file are reflected in thebuildfile's outline. While changes to the outline view in the imported file are reflected immediatelyafter the change is made, it is only upon *saving* the imported file and makinga subsequent change to the main buildfile, that the main buildfile's outlineview is updated.This is a little confusing, but fixing it might be tough to do. We don't reallyhave an incremental ant compiler :). Patch applied and released. Thanks John-Mason.I will look into the reconciliation problem but likely will log it as an enhancement.I think we should see the ""big build file problem"" in the wild before spending more time on it.

49376	[KeyBindings] Space now erroneously runs Completion	"Ctrl-Space has run ""Complete"" until now, but now Shift-Space does also, and Ihave not noticed that before, so I think that is new in either M5 or M6.This is a rather annoying default since I frequently enter text where I need topress shift just before or after a space.  The change means that I cannot justkeep shift down. I can confirm this behaviour. Its new with 3.0M6 and very annoying. I'm seeing the same new behaviour as of M6 and it's especially annoying when writing uppercase strings such as ""SELECT * FROM x"" - my tendancy is certainly to keep shift down while typing the ' ' with the result ""SELECT*FROMx"" in current eclipse. The Shift+Space key-binding was added for incremental completion but has beenremoved since because of the conflicts mentioned. See bug 49265.However, I noticed that in the newest builds (I20040106), space still triggerscontent assist even though the key-binding has been removed. In I20040106, ""Shift+Space"" is still defined as ""Incremental Completion"" in the default key configuration.  I'm marking this as a duplicate of the bug Tom mentioned.  For a possible interim solution, switch to the new ""Standard (3.0)"" key configuration.*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 49265 *** There is still an issue with the key-bindings, though:With the binding to Shift+Space, incremental completion would also be invokedwhen just Space was pressed. Plus, after removing the key-binding (in todaysnightly), Space *still* triggers completion!Adjusted summary In N20040109, on both Linux-GTK and Windows XP, ""Space"" and ""Shift+Space"" do nottrigger completion on my machine.

49360	JUnit view slows down the execution of unit tests. [JUnit]	It seems that for a huge number of tests (I'm using a lot of test suitesgenerated from external test data) Eclipse's JUnit view slows down the executionof the whole suite. I believe that because of showing an execution status forthese test in the test hierarchy, as well as status in the status line. Ibelieve that view can be implemented in a better way, to do not slow down theexecution of unit tests. The showing of the execution status (and revealing the test) can be disabled using the scroll lock control. If this doesn't help then please be more specific and provide some numbers (e.g. running junit tests using the test runner, running tests using the Eclipse JUnit). Erich, scroll lock helps a bit. In my test suite with 4050 test cases it wunsfor 8.9 seconds with scrolling and for ~5.5 seconds without scrolling. Howeverif I run the same test from Ant it take only ~0.3 seconds. I would suggest to update execution status on the status bar not for everychange  but only once in a second. That will save a lot of time on UI updatesthat doesn't actually makes any difference for the user. this is now done with a UIJob.the other overhead comes from creating a proxy test hierarchy inside eclipse. 	2010-05-29 17:45:06	1275170000.0	resolved fixed	ac22dd8	1275330000.0	java/org/apache/catalina/ha/session/BackupManager.java java/org/apache/catalina/ha/session/DeltaManager.java java/org/apache/catalina/session/PersistentManagerBase.java

49269	The CopyCommand does not preserve order for bi-directional references	The problem is that when copying an EObject that has bi-directional referencesto other EObject instances the order of the referenced objects is notmaintained in the copy.  The problem is described in more detail in an eclipse.tools.emf posting dated 12/19/03.  The response by Frank Budinsky was:The copy command, which is a fairly old piece of code, should be handlingbidirectional references the way EcoreUtil.copy() does it. Notice that theEcoreUtil.Copier.copyReference() method calls addUnique() or move() to make sure everything is added at the right position.

49207	Badindentation and TAB key behavior after an opening parenthesis	"I am reporting what I consider a new, flawed behavior of the TAB key in 3.0M5,as compared to the 2.1.x versions.My test scenario:I enter a line in the Java editor which ends with a ( and hit ENTER.In both 2.1.x and 3.0M5 the caret is moved to the following line (as expected).However, 3.0M5 automatically inserts 2 extra tabs in that new line. 2.1.x doesnot try to outsmart me and places the caret at the indentation level, i.e.start of the new line in context of the current block. At this point I shouldmention that I want to indent the following line with just ONE tab. Example:{    someMethodName(        arg1, arg2, arg3); // ok!}What 3.0M5 forces is:{    someMethodName(            arg1, arg2, arg3); // WRONG!} So to get back to preferred state in 3.0M5, I have to hit backspace 4 timesafter hitting ENTER (as I use space-for-tab substitution).There is yet another related situation in which 3.0M5 ""helps"" to reduce mytyping speed and temper. Suppose that I place the caret at the blockindentation level (below ""s"" in the example), or even an the very beginningof the line following the one with (. When I hit TAB now, and it results ina huge caret jump to the location where ""arg1"" begins in the flawed version.I thought that it may be some new crazy preference in 3.0, but I did not findany way to disable it.

49184	Cumulative time for main() is much less than expected on iSeries	On the iSeries, the cumulative time for the main() method is too small. For our InOut test case, the cumulative time for main() is 0.062582 sec but the actual elapsed time is 8.788 sec.This is an iSeries JVMPI specific bug. To obtain proper method timings on AS/400 the java application needs to be runin either interpreted mode (VM argument '-interpret') or pure jit mode (VMarguments '-Dos400.enbpfrcol=1 -Djava.compiler=jitc'). Running with DE (DirectExecution) enabled -- which is the default mode -- causes the sequence of methodentry/exits that we receive from the java application to be incorrect. Seedocumentation bug 59831 for details. (I was able to reproduce this bug whenrunning in the default mode with DE enabled, but the problem disappeared when Iswitched to pure-jit mode.) (Note, if running in one of these modes, you still may end up seeing anunacceptably large overhead from the profiler -- e.g., the cumulative timereported by the profiler for the main method may be larger than the timereported by the program itself.

49141	command line processing needs improvements	"Previously there was some amount of command line consumption caused by code from update.   Things like -noupdate, -feature, etc were consumed by the main() or Platform.startup().  As a result, they were not passed on to applications (like AntRunner).With the extraction of the update (and other) code from the startup sequence, the consumption of these args has stopped.  As a result, the args are showing up on the app command line.  Apps like AntRunner are somewhat confused.There are other args we are consuming that we probably should stop.  This iwll make the problem worse.  Unfortunately, there are parts of the system which need configuration but are neither part of the runtime or part of the appliation (e.g., update).  How do we pass args to them?Certainly the system property approach is workable but it is less than optimal for the userAnother option is to allow arg consumers to signal the runtime that they have consumed the argument.  This works as well but a) requires extra api/structure b) is prone to error on the part of the consumers c) does not solve the problem of arg collisions (e.g., what if AntRunner had a -application switch?)d) has a race condition in that the args must be setup before the app is runThoughts and comments welcome. In the new re-work of the startup code, Update Manager will not need command line arguments (other than the -force/freeze argument we discussed to lock a configuration). I will update the bug once I get back from vacation and get some work done. Great.  When you get back, we should consider if the force/freeze function should be controlled by a command line arg or if it is essentially a utility that someone runs on a config to freeze it.  I.e, would you expect people to be running with -freeze all the time or just one time?  Thanks Can we pick this up and decide what we need? Here is my proposal:a). do not support any command line arg for controlling ""freeze""/""cascade""b). there are two scenarios    1. shared install with read-only install directory: when a user launches        eclipse in his own account, we automatically create a new configuration       directory.        - if the user configuration directory already exists and populated with        appropriate files, just use it.       - If the shared install directory does not have a configuration       dir, then we create the full content of the configuration dir       (by picking up all the features/plugins available).       - If there is a shared configuration, then the configuration created       for each user will ""cascade"" it, by linking to the shared config info.       So, the user config will initially consist of just one link that will       be processed and the configuration initialized from the shared location       and treated as ""read-only"", i.e. no installs/updates/enable/disable are       allowed on features from the shared config.       The user can still install new features under his own directories, and       this info will be added to the local config.      2. shared or local install, but with -configuration:       Apply the same algorithm as above, where the shared location is considered to be the eclipse installation, and the user location is what -configuration points to. This seems reasonable except it does not allow someone to freeze their configuration and isolate it from updates to the shared install.  I like the idea of NOT using a command line arg but there should be some ability to basically collapse the cascade into the users area. That looks like an advance feature, and the user can simply do it by copying the configuration himself. I am not sure a raw copy of the configuration is going to work - the URLs may be relative to the original location and may need to be expanded/modified.  I think a raw copy of the configuration should work. All sites within an install would have to be saved with platform:/base/some_path/. The other paths will be saved absolutely. The only issues is if some file systems are mounted with different paths in root and user's accounts, but in that case our code won't be able to do a better job either. BTW, we may need to revisit the proposal for variable substitution in site paths (I think it was Mel who was willing to provide the code). Command line processing has been rationalized and cleaned up.  We have not done any variable substitution and likely will not for 3.0.

49116	[Workbench] Two debug views	"I20031218 0955I got into a state where there were two debug views tiled together (see attachedimage).When I closed one debug view, the other tab remained, but the view content areawas blank.  I then moved another view into the group (console view).  When Iclosed the console view, the remaining debug view was back to normal (showingusual contents in content area). Created attachment 7230JPG showing window with two debug views. John did you have an exception happening at the time? I am wondering if it is related to your other problem. Yes, it initially happened at the same time as bug 49115.  However, there isstill some weirdness with the debug view presentation after I shut down andrestart. This is reproducible, so you're welcome to come by and take a look. Created attachment 7235Blank debug view (reproducible) This seems to be fairly easy to reproduce in 3.0 M6: - Shutdown workbench with the debug perspective open, but not as the activeperspective. - Restart - Launch a program in debug mode (with option turned on to automatically switchto debug mode on launch).-> The window switches to debug perspective, but debug view is blank (just likepicture in comment #4). Workaround is to tile another view on top of the debugview, then move it again to reveal the normal debug view. We did a bit of archeology on my workspace.  It looks like the phantom debugview was persisted in my workbench.xml:<folder activePageID=""org.eclipse.debug.ui.DebugView""><page content=""org.eclipse.debug.ui.DebugView"" label=""Debug""/><page content=""org.eclipse.ui.views.ResourceNavigator"" label=""Navigator""/><page content=""org.eclipse.jdt.ui.PackageExplorer"" label=""Package Explorer""/><page content=""org.eclipse.jdt.ui.TypeHierarchy"" label=""Hierarchy""/><page content=""org.eclipse.debug.ui.DebugView"" label=""Debug""/></folder>Note that the debug view is in the folder twice.

This creates inconsistancies in the two types of widgets. On resize events, the windows native widget maintains state information when items are forced to new lines. When the window is resized back to normal, the cool items flow back to their original order(jump rows). In Linux (GTK and Motif) and MacOS, the cool bar introduces ""hard"" breaks when the cool items are forced to a new row.

The order stored in the java file is not maintained.The second problem is that certain properties cannot be setbefore other properties. Because of this we must be able to modifythe order of the properties, plus we need a registry of what the proper order is for a particular class.For example, JTextField, can't set selectionStart until after Text has beenset. The problem is in this example is that the order of properties returnedis independent of the order set, and due to hashing, the selectionStart maybe applied before text has been set, even though in the code it is the other wayaround.Waiting on EMF to support this concept. *** Bug 48553 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** *** Bug 78937 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** *** Bug 109364 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** 	2010-01-20 11:54:45	1264010000.0	resolved fixed	9e55819	1266310000.0	java/org/apache/jasper/security/SecurityClassLoad.java

This would also allow Table to reclaimthe resources for TableItems that are no longer visible.Alternatively, the SWT Table widget could provide a Listener interface thatsends notifications when rows gain and lose visibility, allowing somehigher-level object to implement a deferred creation strategy. *** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 37998 *** 	2009-12-13 16:24:30	1260740000.0	resolved fixed	0e595cf	1266090000.0	java/org/apache/catalina/servlets/DefaultServlet.java

It works for native libs etc.  This is needed for SWT scenarios.In the SWT case it is possible to have several SWTs installed at the same time.  Of course, when you run, only one should be selected.  The SWT plugin in Eclipse classic has $ws$/swt.jar on the classpath.  The plugin itself never contains that jar, it always comes from fragments by processing the $ws$ directive while searching for the jar.Without this capability the swt.jars from Motif and GTK will both get added to SWT's classpath (or just the first one found).  Both situations are less than optimal.

48421	Need to open-up the plugin converter	"The idea here is something simple.  When calling the converter we would allow people to express, for example, classpath entries contained in host bundles (if generating for a fragment) or jars present in fragments (if generating for a host).  We do not want the converter to get into grovelling over some sort of plugin registry style structure to discover ""the big picture"".  It needs to be told the information and it will use what it is told. It could also be interesting to have a flag saying is we want to generate the legacy flags and things like that.The generated manifests also need to contain information like provider, plugin-name, etc.Depending on the story adopted for the translation of manifests, some extra generation might be required here. This has been fixed. The converter now supports a flag indicating if legacyheaders should be created or not. This seems to suit Wassim's needs. As of today the plugin converter generates manifest one by one ignoring all other bundles. This has a limitation for bundles that do not have their own jars like SWT.The idea in opening the converter is to give capabilities to PDE (who has the global view of the system) to say what to generates for those cases.

Remember - our patterns are generic and not bound to plugin/id composition.  Youcan currently use path segments in pattern bindings, although such patterndefinitions would be specific to help applications.  In the UI components we'vetaken the pattern of using the plugin ID followed by a  '/' and then followed bythe local component ID in our matching tests.  You could do the same, replacinglocal component id with the path segment.  Can you give this a try and tell meif this solution is adequate?  If so I'll mark this as WORKSFORME. Since patterns can be regular expressions - no limit on number of ""/""s, and pattern binding allow associating multiple patterns to activity, the functionality is good enough.

48112	"[GlobalActions] ""Forward"" & ""Back"" global actions dont seem to be global"	"and yes, the above code with PREVIOUS and NEXT actions works. Is the intro area implemented as a view in the hacked up version?If so, do the FORWARD and BACK actions get retargeted properly if registered in the view itself?  Note that the view must be the active part. Nick,yes, the IIntroArea was hacked up as a view in this defect. But lets get the IIntro stuff out of the picture. I have a view that has the above code snippet. I can override the NEXT and PREVIOUS actions from the Navigate menu, but I cant do that for the FORWARD and BACK actions. Am I missing something? Arent these actions global? Yes, these are both retargetable and they both work for regular views.Try the following:- in the Package Explorer, select a project, package or folder- Navigate > Go Into- Navigate > Go To > Back- Navigate > Go To > Forward- Navigate > Go To > UpNote that these actions are different from the editor history navigation actions in the main toolbar, which are not retargetable.The arrows in the Package Explorer's local toolbar -do- correspond to FORWARD and BACKWARD though. Nick,I guess that was my source of confusion. I was referring to what you call ""editor history navigation actions in the main toolbar"". ie: from main menu go to Navigate -> Back / Forward.You say that they are not retargetable, which is fine. I guess these are dedicated for editor hitory navigation, and you dont want to confuse that. ok. But then isnt it a bit confusing to make the Next and Previous (in the same drop down menu) retargettable? while the Back and Forward are not? Not only that, the Next and Previous are context sensistive, while the Back and Forward are not. Its just a bit confusing to absorb. Please correct me if Im wrong. Also, maybe I havent searched enough, but I could have sworn that I read in the javadoc somewhere taht the Forward and Back are part of the actions that can be retargetted. Mazen.    I tried registering my own actions against the Forward and Back global actions, and my action doesnt seem to be invoked.here is the code snippet:// register with global action service.IActionBars actionBars = introArea.getActionBars();actionBars.setGlobalActionHandler(ActionFactory.FORWARD.getId(),forwardAction);actionBars.setGlobalActionHandler(ActionFactory.BACK.getId(),backAction);am I missing something? The above code does not enable any of the Forward or Back action in the Eclipse Navigate menu. If I use PREVIOUS and NEXT all words well.thanksMazen Faraj nick, can you comment on this?  Perhaps these methods haven't been implemented yet.It's unclear that IIntroSite should extend IWorkbenchSite since it doesn't really belong to a page or a window.  I'd keep them separate for now, add what you need to IIntroSite, then look at refactoring it under one of the existing site interfaces later. Huh?  Nick, did you mean that as a comment for Bug 49117?  And if so, did youmean to assign this bug to me? This seems to be related to bug 49117 since Mazen's code above is talking to the intro area.I was guessing that setGlobalActionHandler on the IIntroArea's IIActionBars is not implemented, and that you were the one implementing this. I assumed by intro area he meant the hacked-up version they were usinginternally.  NONE of the new IIntro stuff should work at the moment, only theinterfaces have been checked in.  If PREVIOUS and NEXT are working for him hemust be using existing API. Apologies for the confusion! :) Yes, Kim is right.. I opned this defect a while back when I was playing around with a hacked IIntroArea implemented as a view. I got the actionBars throught the Eclipse view and I tried registering these two global actions but the code didnt work. The defect is still valid, confusing but valid.

48006	[SWT] layout problems on mac	"Doug, this might be an SWT issue in general (I notice that there are some minor layout problems on a few other dialogs, i.e. find/replace on the mac has its combo boxes a little too close together), but the Keys preference page is the biggest offender.As i've done nothing with the layout in some time, and you've recently changed the page by adding a tab folder, etc. I'll let you have a crack to see if you can find the problem, otherwise SWT might know something about this already.. I don't think I can really debug a Mac-specific layout problem.  You're going tohave to help me here.  I can tell you that ""createControl"" now responds with bycreating a tab folder on the composite it is passed.  This tab folder has twotabs, and the rest pretty much follows from there.  I'm not sure how this couldbe affecting the Mac layout.Perhaps an SWT problem?  You can try punting it to them, or poke around yourselfon your Mac to see what is causing the problem....I don't think this causes ""crashes, loss of data, severe memory leak"" or ""majorloss of function"".  Downgrading to normal. The Combo layout problems have been fixed in #47894However, I this does not fix the layout problems on the keys pref page. Strange, I got the layout problem only once after applying the patch for bug #47894.Since then I'm no longer able to reproduce the problem.A resize of the pref window might have fixed that... There still is a problem:I've installed a fresh I20031202 (empty workspace) and updated SWT to contain the fix for #47894.Launched Eclipse and opened Keys pref page.-> Layout is broken.Resized pref window, switched to other pref page,switched back to Keys pref page-> Layout is OK. i loaded SWT from HEAD and agree that most problems go away because of the combo box fix. still, layout within the tab folder seems to be quite broken. it initially opens too large. shrinking the preference dialog causes even more problems. i've confirmed this behavior doesn't happen on gtk with the same code.. moving to SWT.. Moving to SSQ.  To summarize, go to the Keys preference page. *** Bug 49306 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** I have created bug 49306, which is now marked as a duplicate of this bug. I just want to repeat what i'ver written there, so it doesn't get lost: I have noticed the weird resizing behavior of the key preferences pane with earlier releases too, but with 3.0 M6 is has really gotten worse, because now it resizes in a way, that some important controls are missing from the dialog - namely the context selection (General, Text Editing, Java Source Editing) and the ""Add"", ""Remove"" and ""Restore"" buttons. Resizing or changing the prefs pane doesn't help at all. I'm running MacOSX 10.3.2. I cannot reproduce this problem in latest.The page opens too large on all platforms and if the user changes the size of the dialog, switching pages will not cause the dialog size to be updated.Compute size problems with TabFolder and Group have been fixed.

Is there any information in your log file(/workspace/.metadata/.log) that would indicate why you don't have any? <Pyinson Data Over Head> Neither of those stack traces are related - one is due to a missing file in thePHP  SQL plug-in.

It was a random *.xsd file ... but was on M5, I haven't tested past that.  Fixed after M5.

48370	fragments not searched for classpath entries	In DefaultClassLoader.getClasspath() we are looking for a file to match a given classpath entry.  Currently we only look in the bundle itself, we never consider fragments of the bundle.  This makes the following interesting usecase impossibleBundle A manifest.mfBundle-Classpath: foo.jarBundle B manifest.mfBundle-Host: BundleAwhere bundle A does NOT contain foo.jar and bundle B DOES contain foo.jar I checked in a fix into HEAD.  The currently attached fragments are searched if the classpath entry can not be found in the host.  If few issues with this approach.1.  Any fragments attached after the fact (after the classloader has been created) will not be searched for host classpath entries.  This would force the host to reload so that the classloader could be flushed and re-created.2.  If the fragment happens to include the foo.jar on its classpath as well then the entry for foo.jar will be included twice in the search list for the host.  Once because of the host's classpath and once because of the fragment's.The first issue is probably just a limitation.  The second issue can be resolved by checking for duplicate entries in the search path. 	2009-12-10 17:24:23	1260480000.0	resolved fixed	9be399f	1260530000.0	modules/bayeux/java/org/apache/tomcat/bayeux/request/PublishRequest.java
48324	Rich client improvement	Hello,I would suggest the following improvement for the rich client feature. The principle could be very similar to a web browser. We could imagine to have a web addrees form just under the menu bar. This address field would not be used to display web pages of course, but to access an application and download the needed updated plugin to perform the tool.Exemple :I wa (following...)Example :I want to access the rich client application X build formerly  with Eclipse. I don't want obviously install previously the application on my machine!!! only the minimal subset of eclipse.I write then the URL in my address field , eg http:(or ftp, or file)//eclipse.org/AppliXand then the download is performed and the tool activated...If there is no web connection is available, the perviously downloaded code is run...It is simple to use , and the most important, there is nothing to install, like a web browser..regardsXavier Méhaut (following)to enhance this feature, we coudl also as in a web browser define the default web address (crooesponding actually to the tool we want to use) where to find information...regardsXavier All those ideas of minimal download and download on demand are in mind. However we have other priorities before that, but feel free to contribute :-). This discussion is probably more appropriate in the update component. This is a mass update of Platform Update bugs that have had no activity in three years. Platform Update was replaced in Eclipse 3.4 (2008) by a new provisioning system called Equinox p2. If this bug or enhancement is not already addressed in p2 please enter a new bug report against p2 (RT > Equinox > p2).

47997	No empty line after opening brace [formatter]	"This applies to the new code formatter preference page in I20031203. It seems to me that the only way to disable empty lines after the opening brace of classes is to disable _all_ empty lines within classes. This is especially ugly when wrapping before opening braces. Looking at the following example, I'd like to get rid of the marked empty lines. I propose an extra option for this.public class Example{                        <--- THIS LINE    public static class Pair    {                        <--- AND THIS ONE        public String first;        public String second;    };    private LinkedList fList; Created attachment 7048my formatting settings *** Bug 48010 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** Moving to core, this is a formatter issue. Olivier, can you comment? just to bring in my suggestion from Bug 48010. The options that state ""blank line before method/variable declaration"" should possibly be changed to ""blank line between method/variable declaration"" because the option ""blank lines before a declaration of some kind"" takes care of the number of spaces at the top of the class. I will investigate how to do this without adding too many options. So basically I should change existing settings to be called ""between"" instead of ""before"" for the field, member and methods.In this case, I should add a new option to insert blank lines at the beginning of the type body.Could this solve your problem? +1 I would agree with comment 6.. although I suspect there may not be a need for the new option as I would imagine everyone would set the number of blank lines at the beginning of the type body to 0. I may be wrong! I prefer to keep some flexibility. In this case, the default value would be 0 and it could be changed if necessary.I am investigating.Silvio, I let you know what the new option name will be. I am not sure the renaming is necessary. We can keep existing name and simplyadd a new option to insert blank lines before the first body declarations. Thereason why I don't like too much the renaming in ""between"" is that it impliesthat new lines are inserted only between body declarations of the same type(between fields means that a new line is inserted only between two fields).Any comment?I am working on adding the new option, but I need some feedback to know the wayI should change the existing options. you can keep the names the same but somehow make it clear that the new option will override any other whitespace at the top of a type + of course make sure that the option does override it! or you can rename the other options to ""blank line before method/variable declaration except if declared at top of a type"" I think this is a little bit too long.Silvio, let me know the way you want to rename options or leave them as is.On my side, I will add the new option and send you a patch to update the UI. Fixed and released in HEAD.Silvio, please add the corresponding option in the UI. Ok, so I guess, I am somewhat late now :-) But if read you correctly, there is now a setting which gives me this layout:public class Example{    public static class Pair    {        public String first;        public String second;    };    private LinkedList fList;...If this is the case, I am happy. :-) "	2009-10-14 17:45:53	1255560000.0	resolved fixed	58162ed	1258920000.0	java/org/apache/catalina/core/NamingContextListener.java

48252	"Difficulty creating ""swt-like"" fragment"	"eclipse-SDK-I20031202-win32I created a fragment in M5 that replaces some functionality in an existing plugin.  I did this by:1. modifying the plugin's plugin.xml to include an additional runtime jar ""replace.jar"" (first in the list of jars)2. creating a fragment that contained:a. replace.jar (this is not window system specific so is just in the root directory of the fragment)b. a fragment.xml that imported the necessary plug-ins to make replace.jar run correctly.  There is no runtime declaration for replace.jarIn M5 (pre-osgi) the previous steps worked successfully.  The plugin is augmented with both replace.jar and the additional imports.In the first osgi build, I appear to be failing.  I say ""appear"" because my pre-osgi debugging steps are not available so I could be making a trivial pilot error.  First failure: check to see if the fragment is installed (not shown in current configuration details - e.g., cannot see swt fragment).  bug 46494 makes me believe that this should work.bug 43658 discusses how swt works, however, I see manifest files in the swt plug-in and fragment so there may be additional steps I need to do (but did not see any requirement for additional steps in the porting guide).Please advise.  We need to be able to do something like this (target: M6).  Given that swt works, I hypothesize that I am either missing some required step or just pilot error. The plugin conversion mechanism is not capable of generating the correct manifest.mf for plugins/fragments which do not contain their own code.  When the converter runs it analyzes the jars and determines what packages would be provided to people via the <library> tags and the export attribute.  In your (and the SWT) case the library statement is in the plugin but the jar is in the fragment.  Since the converter works on a bundle by bundle basis, when converting the plugin.xml it does not have global knowledge of the fragments available and cannot locate the jar in question.  Similarly, when converting the fragment.xml there is no library statement so there is nothing to generate.Net result: the Provide-Package list is likely empty in both cases.The porting guide does not mention this case.  The PDE conversion tool can do a better job of generating the manifests since it does have the global knowledge required to locate the jars etc.  A stub/reminder has been added to the porting guide and will be completed this week.In the meantime the easiest thing to do is to copy the jar from the fragment to the plugin and then generate the manifest using the PDE tool.  This will get you a plugin that says it provides all the relevant packages.  Then delete the jar from the plugin.  I don't think you will have to generate the fragment manifest manually.BTW, the configuration details issue is being worked on. To see what is installed, start with -console and then type ""ss"" in the console.  That will list all the bundles and their state.  You want to see RESOLVED or ACTIVE. This bug has been partially fixed by bug #48370 and bug #48371. Fixes are available in build after I20031209.The manifest generation problem will be fixed with #48421, although the on-the-fly generation is unlikely to be supported due to restriction captured in the PR.Closing.

Check out pde.core from CVS.You will see that pde.core does not compile anymore, even though its manifest does contain the dependency on org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility.Not sure if it's a problem with Equinox restructuring or the JDT compiler.cc Philippe.Here is the compilation error, which did not occur when compiling against previous Equinox builds.The type org.eclipse.osgi.service.environment.Constants cannot be resolved. It is indirectly referenced from required .class files.	TargetPlatform.java	org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/core	line 0	December 7, 2003 10:39:31 AM Wassim: does it work better if you manually add org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility on the build path ? If I import org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility and all its prereqs into my workspace, the classpath container of pde.core adapts and puts the project org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility on its classpath.  A rebuild kicks in.  However, the compilation error remains. The problem is definitely in Platform/Core land.org.eclipse.core.boot.BootLoader in the org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility plug-in implements the org.eclipse.osgi.service.environment.constants.Constants interface.This interface comes from the org.eclipse.osgi plug-in.  However, it is in the eclipseAdaptor.jar, and this jar is not exported by the org.eclipse.osgi plug-in.  So it was not put on the classpath of pde.core.The reason why this problem probably went unnoticed by the Core team is because they have all their osgi plug-ins as source in their workspace.  Since all source folders of a Java project are exported (i.e. there is no current support for ""not"" exporting a source folder), everything compiled fine.  However, when we are dealing with JARs, the problem was easily exposed. Glad to hear this.  I am suspicious of the repreq computation.  I have all the runtime projects in my workspace (checked out from CVS) and then loaded pde.core from CVS.  I am targetting N1207.I get a similar but different compile error (specifically     The type org.eclipse.update.configurator.IPlatformConfiguration$ISitePolicy cannot be resolved. It is indirectly referenced from required .class files.	TargetPlatform.java	org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/core	line 0The classpath for pde.core has only the JRE and Required plugin containers.  Expanding the required plugin container you see Ant, resources, ... and the only runtime related entry is for the runtime.compatibility project.It should have     org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility    org.eclipse.core.runtime    org.eclipse.osgi    org.eclipse.update.configuratorand perhaps even     org.eclipse.osgi.utilHaving said that it is not clear there is enough information for PDE to have figured this out.  Does PDE populate its model based on manifests or plugin.xmls?  The plugin.xml has the above list explicitly.  The manifests are more subtle.The runtime.compatibility manifest includesRequire-Bundle:  org.eclipse.core.runtime; provide-packages=true,so core.runtime should be there.It also includes the entryImport-Package:  org.eclipse.update.configurator,While this does not say that compatibility absolutely requires the update.confgiruator plugin, it does say that it needs a package called org.eclpise.update.configurator.  You and I know that that package is in the similarly named plugin but how does PDE?  There are two ways.  The real way is for PDE to use the same state/resolver objects that the runtime uses to do the dependency computations for the target.  This would allow it to discover all the prereqs for a particuler plugin regardless of whether the prereq came via a Require-Bundle or an Import-Package.  The only flaw in this is that OSGi allows for cirularities and we do not seem to be happy with that.The other, somewhat temporary and much lower tech way is via the build.properties file.  The build.properties for runtime.compatibility lists    extra.prerequisites = org.eclipse.update.configuratorPDE build currently uses this to figure out basically the same thing that PDE core needs.  Ideally both would use the first approach but we have not had time to port.  If cycles become an issue we may well need some sort of side mechanism like this for disambiguating cases.  In PDE core is it not too bad since JDT actually allows cycles.  It gets more difficult with PDE build since building with cycles and Ant will be harder.Note that it looks to me like the build.properties for runtime is missing the line    extra.prerequisites = org.eclipse.osgi,org.eclpise.utilI say ""looks like"" because the manifest has imports a mess of packages from thees two but there is no explicit prereq statement (either in the manifest or in the build.properties).  PDE build is still based on plugin.xmls and the runtime plugin.xml still lists these two as plugin prerequisites.Summary:  There are several problems.  - PDE Core should be seeing compatibility's dependency (and reexporting) of runtime. (check that you are looking for the ""provide-packages"" attribute correctly)- PDE Core needs to use one of the two ways defined above to find Import-Package dependencies (preferrably by using the real dependency computation)- PDE Build needs to get on the real dependency computatoin- We need to delete our plugin.xmls.  They are just confusing things- The use of extra.prerequisites needs to either be consisent and correct or stopped.Re comment #3, what does it mean to export a jar? I'm a little more awake and while the bulk of comment #5 stands, I understand more now what is happening.  org.eclipse.osgi is not really an OSGi bundle.  It IS OSGi so in the same way that org.eclipse.core.boot is not a plugin, org.eclipse.osgi is not a bundle.  In OSGi terms it is ""the system bundle"" or ""bundle 0"".We have put a plugin.xml in there to make it look like a plugin to the tooling.  To make matters a little worse, the manifest for org.eclipse.osgi is not a MANIFEST.MF.  It is actually in a file called SYSTEMBUNDLE.MF in the META-INF dir of the framework/src dir.  To add to that, the framework is open such that implementations can effectively add manifest entries through ADAPTOR.MF files.I know that the ADAPTOR.MF mechanism is not inthe OSGi spec.  It is unclear if the SYSTEMBUNDLE.MF is though.  What we need is a way to describe the contents of the system bundle.  Since there may be different adaptors this is not as easy as putting in a fake MANIFEST.MF (though this would perhaps be an interrim solution) since there is only one of these.I also see what you mean by exporting the jar.  I'll add that to the plugin.xml pending further information.  By the way of explanation, we recently moved the constants class in question in to the eclipseAdaptor.jar so this is why we have not seen this issue before. Jeff, you certainly have a lot to say <g>.  Let me clarify what you saw and why saw it:When you had org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility and other core plugins in your workspace, the classpath of pde.core only need to contain a project reference to core.runtime.compatibility.  pde.core's classpath does not need to explicitly have a project reference to the plugin projects that runtime.compatibility, because these plugins are on core.runtime.compatibility's classpath and are reexported, so pde.core's gets visibility to them without explicitly referencing them.When we're dealing with external plug-ins, then all the JARs of core.runtime.compatibility and the imports that it reexports need to be on pde.core's classpath.eclipseAdaptor.jar is not reexported, so org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility does not have visibility to the Constants interface, and that is why we have a problem with pde.core not compiling.Reexporting eclipseAdaptor.jar in the plugin.xml of org.eclipse.osgi will certainly me everyone happy. Thanks for the clarification regarding the re-exporting.  That makes sense.  The change to runtime's plugin.xml has been released.It is still unclear though how PDE builds its model in the area of runtime.  Actually, I realize that you use the plugin.xml but what the story be going forward when we don't have a plugin.xml?  The most direct approach would be to spoof a MANIFEST.MF but this has unfortunate side-effects for the OSGi project which can be used in many different ways.Also, what is the PDE current approach and plan for handling Import-Package derived dependencies? To be honest, I haven't looked yet at how classpath is going to be computed in the absence of a plugin.xml.  This is mainly because I haven't heard a definitive decision yet that we are effectively deprecating the plugin.xml.Are you trying to tell me something? No I was not trying to tell you something but yes we are deprecating the plugin.xml and fragment.xml files.  These will be maintained as legacy but 3.0 plugins should use MANIFEST.MF and eclipse.xml (currently called extensions.xml).I'm writing those sections of the porting guide right now... The SYSTEMBUNDLE.MF and ADAPTOR.MF files are not OSGi specified.  They are just an implementation specific way of specifying exported packages for the System Bundle.Do we need to come up with a more general way of specifying the system bundles contents?Currently we define the base System Bundle contents in the /META-INF/SYSTEMBUNDLE.MF file in core.jar and then add to the exported packages and services of the System Bundle by asking the Adaptor with the FrameworkAdaptor.getExportedPackages() and FrameworkAdaptor.getExportedServices() methods.  The default implementation just looks in the file /META-INF/ADAPTOR.MF file to get the values to return for these methods.  This does not help tooling because only the framework can call these methods on the adaptor so you are left with reading the ADAPTOR.MF files yourself.These files are contained with in the jars of the org.eclipse.osgi ""plugin"" so it is not real easy for tools to gain access to them. In I20031209, I tried something.Remove compatibility from pde.core plugin.xmlThen import the plugin with source.The first thing to note is that the build path being used is not a dynamic. The second thing is that this classpath does not contains org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility and therefore pde.core does not compile.Then I switched to the ""dynamic classpath"" and everything worked fine: compatibility was added to the classpath.Moving to PDE-UI Pascal, this bug has been resolved at the OSGi end.  I'm not sure what you are observing that is wrong:>The first thing to note is that the build path being used is not a dynamic.I'm assuming that you are talking about the build path of the plug-in you imported.  That is right, by default, dynamic classpaths is not on.  You have to turn it on on the PDE>Java Build path control preference page.  If you had, the classpath of anything you import will be a dynamic classpath. >The second thing is that this classpath does not contains >org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility and therefore pde.core does not >compile.You explicitly removed org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility from the plugin.xml of pde.core and then you were shocked that this plugin was not added to the classpath of pde.core.  Of course, it is not going to be added.  The classpath does not contain anything for free.  runtime.compatibility has been explicitly declared as a dependency by pde.core in order for it to be added to its classpath.In any event, the bug for which this report was opened was a problem with the reexporting of osgi libraries which has since been fixed by Jeff.

Maybe it is the lock on delete, but I just wanted to make sure that you knew about it too.

This was somewhat intentional. This way we can test the UI responsiveness and backwards compatibility.

I observed this behavior as well, but we do define a label in our plugin.xml/plugin.properties.Any clue ? Moving to platform ant (external tools support) I am not able to reproduce the problem.Is this for all of your projects?Is the label always missing?Any particular test case?Thanks. I see the same problem.In the builders properties page of org.eclipse.ant.core, only 'Built Ant SupportJAR' has a label, the other 3 builders have no label. I see it too (or rather, do not see labels). OK...I am missing labels in my host but not in my runtime-workbench target?Something strange afoot... Pascal the labels that are missing are generated using the code in BuilderPropertyPage.getBuildName(String builderID):----IExtension extension = Platform.getPluginRegistry().getExtension(ResourcesPlugin.PI_RESOURCES, ResourcesPlugin.PT_BUILDERS, builderID);String builderName;if (extension != null) {	builderName = extension.getLabel();} else {	builderName = MessageFormat.format(ExternalToolsUIMessages.getString(""BuilderPropertyPage.missingBuilder""), new Object[] { builderID }); //$NON-NLS-1$}return builderName;---------It would appear that in the host workspace, extension.getLabel() is returning an empty string, whereas in a PDE runtime-workbench the correct label of the extension is returned. Is this a known issue? This sounds like a runtime issue...Moving to equinox-general and renaming. There were several problems.

48150	Embedding Excel in IEditorPart changes Workbench menus	"Overview/Steps to reproduce :Embed .xls file as OLE document in the IEditorPart. If that editor is opened,the workbench menus are replaced by the .xls menus {Edit, View, Insert, Format,Tools, Data, Help}. Even if the active editor is changed to something else, theoriginal workbench menus do not show up. The only way to get back the workbench menus is to close the editor that has OLEdocument. Expected behavior :When the active editor is say Java Editor, the workbench should show theoriginal set of menus, and not the OLE document specific menus. When the activeeditor is the one embedding the OLE doc, the document specific menus should beshown.Additional Information :	/**	 * @see org.eclipse.ui.IWorkbenchPart#createPartControl(Composite)	 */	public void createPartControl(Composite parent) {		GridLayout layout = new GridLayout();		layout.numColumns = 1;		layout.marginHeight = 0;		layout.marginWidth = 0;		layout.verticalSpacing = 0;		parent.setLayout(layout);		OleFrame oleContainer = new OleFrame(parent, SWT.NONE);		GridData frameGridData = new GridData(GridData.FILL_BOTH);		frameGridData.horizontalAlignment = GridData.FILL;		frameGridData.verticalAlignment = GridData.FILL;		oleContainer.setLayoutData(frameGridData);		oleContainer.setSize(500, 500);		OleClientSite excelSite = new OleClientSite(oleContainer, SWT.BORDER, outputFile);				excelSite.doVerb(OLE.OLEIVERB_PRIMARY);		parent.setSize(parent.getSize());         } VI, not sure if this is OLE or UI. When OleFrame.setFileMenus(new MenuItem[] {fileItem}) is done, the workbenchmenus are not returned even after the Excel editor is closed. There is just the'File' menu and nothing else on the menu bar. Are you really using 2.1.1?  If so, please retry with 2.1.2 - some fixes where made for hangs in Ole in 2.1.2 which may be causing your problem Sorry for the confusion, I am indeed using 2.1.1 with Excel 2002 SP-1, themodified problem statement is explained again here (Note : The followingbehavior is same in SWT 2.1.2 as well) :Case 1:If I open a .csv (comma separated format) file in the Editor along with a texteditor, we can reproduce the problem I have stated in the original bug report.Case 2: If I open a .xls file in the Editor along with a text editor, then the menusfunction properly, though the display process has some flicker.Case 3: (This is a new addition)If I open a .xls, a .csv and a text file, then   (a)  .xls editor has its own Excel specific and Platform menus (appropriate)   (b)  .csv and text editors both have the menus pertaining to text editor.and (c)  the .csv editor becomes uneditable sometimes showing row and columnheaders and sometimes not. How do you open the .csv file - are you writing your own editor or embedding another Ole object?The problem is that you must be very careful about the order in which things become activated.See:https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=17480When an Ole editor is activated or deactivated it changes the menu shown.  Therefore, if you are switching between two Ole editors you must deactivate the one that you are leaving before activating the one you are going to.  The same is true when going between an Ole editor and a non-Ole editor.  You need to deactivate the Ole Editor before you activate the text editor.  The Eclipse Text editor gets it right and the Eclipse OleEditor gets it right - use those as your examples. Got it, thx!I was writing my own editor embedding OleFrame and expected OleFrame to takecare of menus. A gross blunder on my part :(!! But looks like .csv files can be opened in Excel by double clicking inWindowsExplorer, but do not get opened in OleEditor by doubleclicking inResourceNavigator. I can live with that for now... or can open a bug report if you suggest. Created attachment 7122screenshot of creating file associationIn Window -> Preferences update you file associations to map *.csv to Excel -see attached screen shot.After you add *.csv to the top area, click on ""Add"" in the bototm area tocreate the association with Excel.

48149	Synchronizing RTF files always reports same	"I have some MS Word RTF documents in my project. I have added the documents successfully to the projects CVS module. However, now that I have changed the documents with Word (started from Eclipse), Synchronize believes no commit is necessary. It consistently reports no changes and I am not able to commit the changed version to the repository. Even when I just ""commit"" without synchrinizing first, nothing happens.Things I checked:- The Eclipse properties for the local file shows the correct, new date.- In CVS there is only the initial version, with correct (old) date.- The local document is really different from what's in the repository.- The document is checked in as binary.

48139	Plugin import - wizard does not consider target platform refresh	Build 20031202I am developping for Eclipse 2.1 using a self-hosting 2.1 workspace on top of Eclipse SDK 3.0. I wanted to launch Eclipse 2.1 as a runtime workbench so as to run some test suites (due to bug 48125); and thus remembered I needed to import an extra plug-in: org.eclipse.pde.junit.In order to do so, I did the following:- open the file import plug-in wizard- configured the target platform there to point at a 2.1.2 SDK install- select import as binary- press NEXT- in the list of available plug-ins, org.eclipse.pde.junit isn't available(ok as it is not part of the 2.1 delivery)- hit BACK, keep import wizard up,- outside Eclipse, expand the missing plug-in into the 2.1.2 install- back inside Eclipse, import wizard is still up, click on target platform button- in target platform wizard, press RELOAD- observe that org.eclipse.pde.junit is listed, press OK- back into import wizard, press NEXT- observe that org.eclipse.pde.junit is NOT listed (you have to close and reopen the wizard so as to see it) Fixed. 	2009-11-05 08:10:54	1257430000.0	resolved fixed	ab3620c	1257450000.0	java/org/apache/catalina/startup/Tomcat.java
48137	CVS metafiles always have unix EOL	"(Third time -- at least I copied the Description pane text this time! Thank you bugzilla.)Ok, second time typing this in because I got an error submitting it the first time and Bugzilla told me to hit the Back button and fix it and lost all the data on the form when I did (nice). This will be shorter due to my RSI.Our CVS server is running on an OS X Machine (10.2.6)When checking out a project from CVS on Windows, it is checked out as a Unix project. If you try to perform any CVS actions on the checked out project using Tortoise CVS, you are shown an error message that tells you did. I had typed in the whole message last time but cannot this time (you cannot copy/paste the error message in the dialog -- nice -- they really think of us folk with RSI when designing apps). Problems due to this: Cannot diff (compare) files in Eclipse. Cannot use checked out project with TortoiseCVS.Seen on WinXP and Windows 2000. ""that tells you did"" should be ""that tells you this"" Btw, we are using extssh. Although the problem still appears with open source projects such as Ant and Jetspeed, the compare function in Eclipse works with files in those projects, leading me to believe that the two things are not related. Those projects, when checked out, are also checked out as Unix on Windows.  Update: The issue is *not* with the built-in extssh -- the same thing happens (a Unix checkout is performed on Windows) when using exactly the same ext ssh as TortoiseCVS.When TortoiseCVS is used to checkout the same project, however, it is correctly checked out for Windows. When I check out files on windows, they are checked out in windows format (i.e. CRLF linefeeds). I noticed that the meta files that are saved by Eclispe use Unix line endings (e.g. CVSROOT/Entries). Perhaps this is a problem for Tortoise. Can you verify this (i.e. open the CVS/Entries file in Notepad from the Windows exploere and see what the line endings are for Eclipse and Tortoise). Update: The issue with the diff/compares was completely unrelated. We were running an unsupported version of CVS (1.10). Upgrading it got rid of that issue.However, the main problem remains.More info: http://www.flashant.org/index.php?m=200312#10 Hi Michael, I see the problem with the meta files, yes. I manually altered them to match a repository checked out in Tortoise and still got the warning from Tortoise. Apparently, it is only a warning though and you can disable it from Preferences -> Advanced -> Check not Unix sandbox.I don't know, however, if this will have any ill effects if used with the meta files saved by Eclipse. So the problem is the CVS/Entries file. Does this prevent Tortoise from working or does it just give you a warning? I suspect it's the later. Ignoe my last question. I added it after your last post but before I saw it. I suspect you will not have problems as Eclipse will handle either line ending. I suspect Tortoise will as well. Np, I did the same with your last post :) Tortoise appears to be handling it but just in case I think we'll lay off mixing the two whenever possible. Now that we have the compare issue solved, we don't really need to use Tortoise alongside Eclipse. Good to know that it's assigned to be fixed, though. Thanks! :)   Post 3.0 This was fixed in 3.0 "	2009-11-05 06:13:59	1257420000.0	resolved fixed	18c0edc	1257450000.0	java/org/apache/catalina/Cluster.java java/org/apache/catalina/CometEvent.java

48123	Allow apps to specify multiple Shell image icons for different resolutions	"Native windows apps can set both a small and large system icon for their windows (Shells), but SWT (Win32) only allows setting the small icon ""decorations.setImage(Image)"".  The small icon (generally 16x16) is used on the window decoration and the large (generally 32x32) is used for the Alt-Tab task switcher.  Without being able to specify the large icon, the OS is forced to scale the small icon producing a ragged looking image (the Eclipse icon looks fairly rough in the Alt-Tab window).  Other OSs may have similar functionality that this enhancement may benefit, so this is probably not a Win32 specific problem.  SWT developers are currently forced to chose 1 size Shell icon to work for all platform specific purposes.I am recommending the following additions to the Decorations class API.  Included is a potential Win32 implementation.  Implementations of other OSs should be fairly similar and trivial.  This includes the addition of a new ImageProvider interface which allows the application an opportunity to provide the correct size image based on the platform requirements.public class Decorations extends Canvas {    ...

48121	"ZoomManager's ""Page"" settings cause erratic behavior"	"Keep entering 1% in the zoom combo box and you will see that the diagram keeps shrinking a little by little.  This is because the ZoomManager is interpreting that 1% as ""Page,"" and shrinking the diagram accordingly.  And since it's using the Figure's preferred size to calculate the zoom level, and because changing the zoom level changes its preferred size, when you enter 1% the next time, the new minimum zoom is slightly less than earlier. Set a UI multiplier, and you will see a lot more anomalies for this case.  Simply choosing ""Page"" from the drop-down changes the zoom level four times, causing flickers on the screeng. Fixed.  When setting the zoom level to be page, width, or height, the extra space to the right/bottom of the editor is not removed.  Hence, at the ""Page"" setting, you can still have both scrollbars.  We have decided that we are going to leave it like that. Changing status to fixed.

48120	Zoom Out action is enabled although it doesn't do anything	"1) Make your diagram big enough so that zooming to ""Page"" would require a zoom level that is less than the minimum.  2) Set the zoom level to be the smallest possible from the drop-down combo box.  3) At this point, the zoom out actions will be enabled.4) However, clicking it won't do anything.This is because canZoomOut() -- which invokes getMinZoom() -- takes the ""Page"" zoom setting into account.  However, when getPreviousZoomLevel() is invoked, it just returns the previous setting from the array of zoom levels, and ignores the ""Page"" zoom setting. Fixed.  getMinZoom() does not take the ""Page"" setting into account.  Separated primSetZoom() method -- the range check is done in setZoom(), but not in primSetZoom() -- out of setZoom().  Whenever one of the ""Page"" settings is selected, primSetZoom() is invoked instead of setZoom().

48104	Expose dialogs for creating classpath entries	This is a request to provide non-internal access to the dialogs used to create classpath entries within the JDT UI. These would be simple dialogs or perhaps even just helper methods (e.g. IClasspathEntry[] showExternalJARDialog(Shell shell)) that could be used to present the user with the same dialogs and return a classpath entry. Specifically, the dialogs that appear by clicking on the following buttons on the Java Build Path properties, Libraries tab:  Add JARs...  Add External JARs...  Add Variable..  Add Library...  Add Class Folder...Exposing these dialogs would allow downstream JDT users to create and edit classpath entries outside of the regular JDT dialogs. For instance, providing a UI to set a server's classpath in an editor.Currently, this is done by duplicating the dialogs. Maintenance of duplicate dialogs is an issue, as well as a usability problem since the dialogs are inevitably different. Martin, can you comment on the impact of making such dialogs API. makes sense to add API here Tim, where do you want to use the dialogs ?

47320	Ant view icons for default target confused with Java protected decorator.	"The little blue triangle which overlaps the target is confusing since in theJava view the blue triangle means protected. Just a thought: You could use thesame running-man decorator to mean default target that is used also used to say""this class has a main() method"". The current icon means ""protected"" target, tome, at least ;-)Version 3.0.m5 In JDT, the blue triangle means that protection has not been specified, and is ""default"" (package protected). A yellow diamond indicates ""protected"". Ah, right, thanks for correcting me. Green circle, blue diammond, yellowdiamond, red square, from public to private. Still the Ant choice seems oddsince the default target should be the most public if that makes any sense. Itis more important/visible than the other targets IMHO while a public API is moreimportant than package level one (IMO again). I'd consider the running man more misleading than the current icon, because the default target isn't the only one that's capable of being run.Darin's point about the meaning of the blue delta as ""default"" is correct.The delta overlay really just serves as an accessibility point. For people who can see color, the most noteable thing about the icon is that it's blue instead of green. The delta adds something to the icon's shape for the colorblind.Respectfully disagree with the suggestion. :) "	2009-06-05 08:37:24	1244210000.0	resolved fixed	0f99904	1254070000.0	java/org/apache/catalina/connector/CoyoteAdapter.java

So let's say you drop 4 components onto the JPanel, bring up the dialog, select 2 of the components (so that one is primary), close the dialog, deselect the 2 components and select the other 2 components, bring up the dialog again (which is now blank), it will try to get the alignment command based on the 2 previous components, which still exist but are no longer selected.

46950	Adding first source folder to project looks too complex [code manipulation] [general issue]	"I20031119- create new project with New Project wizard- after specifying the name go to next page (don't use Finish button)- select project and press ""Add Folder""Observe: a new modal dialog appears showing the same information as the original dialog.You can repeat the selection you've already made and you have to press another ""Create New Folder"" button.This feels clumsy (for the 95% case).I suggest either to:- rename the ""Add Folder"" button to ""Add Source Folder"" (because that's what it is).- skip the second dialog if the select project doesn't contain any folders. In this case  there is no need for letting the user select an existing project.or- rename the button ""Add Folder"" to ""Add Source Folder""- and create a new button ""Create Source Folder"" IMO the problem is that most user don't enter the second page so they aren't aware of source folders. So we somehow should give them a hint on the first page that for ""complex"" project setup they should specify different source folders.The dialog that allows adding a folder is provided by platform. Another idea would be to create the new folder inplace in the dialog to avoid another stacked dialog. From the frustration session:give user a hint on first page that Next will allow setting up more complex projects: - simple project - simple with bin and src- complex project (Finish disabled, Next enabled) Remove intermediate dialog when pressing Add Folder  another idea is that when the project is empty and only the project itself is on the classpath as source folder, the 'add foilder' button gies directly to the 'create folder' input dialog Postponing to M7. Several improvements have been released:The first page is improved and lets you select from 3 scenarios and is moreverbose about when the classpath is calculated from existing source.On the second page, the 'add folder' button goes in checkbox tree instead of anormal tree.If only the project exists (and no folder is to choose from), the 'new folder'dialog appears right away.Same for class folders.>20040208 "	2009-04-01 06:33:02	1238580000.0	resolved fixed	e9248d7	1253040000.0	java/org/apache/catalina/core/AprLifecycleListener.java java/org/apache/coyote/http11/Http11AprProcessor.java java/org/apache/tomcat/jni/SSLSocket.java

I could try to create a patch for it. the helpwanted keyword is for bugs hat we are interested in patches for so please feel free. I have started creating a patch, but I've got one doubt. What should be done if a user enters a file name with his own extension, e.g. ""name.txt"" and the default extension is set to ""abc""? Should the extension given by the user be changed or it should be kept? You would want to use the extension provided by the developer - otherwise this would break existing behaviour Ok, so the default extension provided by the developer should be appended to the full name given by the user (with the custom extension)?

47569	consider listening to start level events to start the application	Currently, we have the application runner as a separate bundle with the higheststart level so when it starts we know that all user bundles are startable beforewe run the application.Another approach would be to use the framework event for start level changes asan indication that it is time to start the application. The benefit of thisapproach is that we could get rid of another bundle/project. it would be great is we could do this.  It feels sort of strange/goofy the way things are now.  Need to verify when the startlevel events are sent out. I have prototyped this and it should work.  Basically the code from ApplicationRunner gets moved to runtime.  The curent runnable gets expanded to include all the code including the lookup and creation of the application extension.  This way the runtime can register the Runnable services immediately (without having to wait for all the configurators to run)EclipseStarter listens for start level events and when the start level reaches the determined point, looks for the Runnable (WITHOUT waiting).  If the service is there then we run it and handle any errors right there.  We wold likely have to throw some unchecked exception out of the runnable since java.lang.Runnable does not have a mechanism for passing back results.  (this could be enhanced by having the framework export some more useful runnable class but not now).If the Runnable service is not registered then we there was some horrible error in the runtime. Sounds like a good idea to me.  I think I have a bug though - according to the spec the Startlevel changed event isn't supposed to be broadcast until all affected bundles have started/stopped.  But that isn't how it's working now - it is setting the startlevel asynchronously so the event can show up before all bundles have started.  I'm working on it now. This has been fixed. The code is now in I20031209.

47568	Eclipse deadlocks when switching from Java to CVS perspective	Linux/Motif 3.0M4 on RedHat 9I started running a long job in Eclipse over night, which ran to completion.This morning when I tried switching from Java to CVS perspective, Eclipseappears to have deadlocked. The hourglass cursor is spinning, but only thebackgrounds of the  widgets in the window are redrawing. (From the size andpositioning of the view outlines, it looks like I'm actually in the CVSperspective.) CPU activity in Eclipse's JVM process is 0.0, and there is nothingin the log. I could kill the process, no problem, but wanted to log a bug herefirst and ask for advice if I can somehow coax Eclipse to at least throw me astack dump so I can include a report here on where it got deadlocked. This hashappened once or twice in the past, although I still haven't figured out how toreliably reproduce it. I was able to attach to the process with a debugger and get a backtrace -- whichI unfortunately didn't save. I then detached, and a part of the window wasredrawn and got stuck again. I attached to the process again and this time savedthe backtrace, which I'm attaching separately. This backtrace is different,though, because the first one had a linux_mutex_something as the top call. Thelog is still empty. Created attachment 6984Backtrace of the stalled process Assigning to SWT as this appears to be the only other thing in the traceback other than the vm.  Perhaps it's the vm that's deadlocking and not Eclipse? I've never seen this, though there was another report that mentioned a mutex (bug 47549).  If this happens again then you can try to get a trace by killing it with the -3 switch. Created attachment 7004Another backtrace of a deadlocked eclipseThis time Eclipse deadlocked when running a large application from the IDEbefore I had a chance to switch perspectives. The backtrace obtained with 'kill-3' is attached. The Java app most likely aborted, because its process was goneand no results in the output file. Created attachment 7079Backtrace #3Another lockup, another backtrace. I notice that both last traces hadcore.internal.jobs.WorkerPool and jdt.internal.ui.text.JavaReconciler at ornear the top.

Especially if this will be implemented https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=41058 Currently deferred (still a valid feature request)* Since breakpoint properties are different (by breakpoint type within a model and by debug model), the columns to show in a table can not be generalized. For example Java breakpoints support a hit count, but the hit count API is java specific. Since the breakpoints view displays breakpoints from all debug models, this gets tricky. Can you at least allow to enable and disable break points by adding a checkboxfor each break point? Using popup menu for this purpose is quite inconvenient.Regarding different break point types. Probably it can be resolved by arrangingbreakpopints by type and require model to provide ""renderer"" for its break points. Just for grins, I implemented the checkbox table viewer implementation for quickly toggling the breakpoints' enabled state. I think I like it. Darin, any objections to committing the change? Released checkbox table for breakpoints view, so people can at least have a look. I like the checkbox. Let's leave it for the next build to see if there are any comments/complaints from users. Can you please tell me if it will be in one of the nightly or integrationbuilds? If so, which one? Jared, is this in last night's build? (see previous comments) It is in last night's (20030814) nightly build. It is failed according to this -http://download.eclipse.org/downloads/drops/N-N20030814-200308140010/index.php There's been a discussion about that failure on the eclipse-dev mailing list. If you really want to see the new functionality, you can either wait until tonight's build (Erich says the problem from last night is fixed) or check out the org.eclipse.debug.* plug-ins yourself and drop them into the integration build. No support and no guarantees if you try that, of course. :-) Can you please attach that jar in here? Thank you in advance. Remaining: sortingPossible 3.0 enhancement. How about add support of working sets? It will allow to show only breakpintsthat are visible for the active working set. Such filtering already work quitenicely for CVS live synhronize, propblems, task and some other views. I believethat it will be a good option for a breakpoints view too. Deferred Shall it be discussed for 3.1 release? Eugene, generally the ""resolution"" status of a bug is intended for developers/committers to change. Simply commenting on bugs like this would be preferred. We could add ""Select Working Set..."", ""Deselect Working Set..."" and ""Edit Active Working Set..."", as are in the navigators. No reason for this bug to still be open. We moved to a checkbox viewer for 3.0 and in 3.1 we have support for breakpoint groups (group by project, file, breakpoint type, etc.).

39231	Show some XML attributes in Ant editor outline view	"Ant's editor allows to edit XML files and have a good capability to show outlineof xml document. It will be very convenient to see values of some attributes in the outline viewof Ant editor in the same node as XML element, i.e. ""name"" and ""id"". It willaloow to easily navigate through the groups of the repeatable elements. List ofsuch attributes could be configurable in the editor properties. Is there are a chance to see this feature implemented in one of 3.0 milestones? Eugene this is a low priority new feature. It will likely only happen with help from the community. I just hoped that it can be done during your work on removing dependency on xmlplugin. That change required modification to one small part of the Ant editor support (AntEditorSaxDefaultHandler). Essentially that work is complete (except for bug 45244). We just don't have the time or people to do all of the cool features that we would like (there is really only one person working on the Eclipse Ant integration). Davin, can you please point me what components/plugins/classes can be affectedby the change I'm proposing? Where is the implementation of Ant's outline islocated and also properties dialogs for Ant's editor. It might help me orsomeone else to understand where to look at. Thank you. The code is org.eclipse.ant.ui plugin within the Ant Editor source folder.The outline code is within org.eclipse.ant.internal.ui.editor.outline.Your change mightlikely impact AntEditorContentOutlinePage, AntModel and OutlinePreparingHandler. Darin, I've implemented a tiny change for XMLElement.getDisplayName().    public String getDisplayName() {		// TODO somehow move into preferences		String DEFAULT_ATTRIBUTES = ""name,"";    	StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer( getName());    	for( Iterator it = getAttributes().iterator(); it.hasNext(); ) {			XmlAttribute attribute = (XmlAttribute) it.next();			String name = attribute.getName();			if( DEFAULT_ATTRIBUTES.indexOf( name)>-1) {				sb.append( ' ').append( name).append( ""=\"""").append(attribute.getValue()).append( '\""');			}    	}		// return getName();		return sb.toString();    }It does exactly what I wanted but I'd like to hear your comments on this.By the way, I have kind of bad feelings about the current implemntation ofOutlinePreparingHandler and I believe that it can be easily improved. I'd liketo suggest to introduce interface OutlineisplayNameFormatter that will beresponsible for formatting of the display name for each XMLElement and concreteimplementation of that interface should replace those anonymous inner classesfrom createXmlElement() method. So, generic implementation may take SYSTEMIDfrom xml document, XPath value to match xml element name, list of attributes andformat string. This way it will be much easier to extend and customize Anteditor outline for different XML files (I believe that it should be possible tocreate some generic properties UI for configuring and adding such formatters). Sorry for the delay in a response Eugene...I have been attending a conference. Iwill take a look at your XMLElement change and see what we can do.I agree with your assessment of the XMLElement implementation..see bug 44343 Basic principal looks sound but we would need to allow the user to turn this on and off and figure out how to let the user configure what is shown (which is the tricky part as so many of the XMLElements have attributes that user likely does not want to see).Consider for 3.0 likely best tied to the work with 44343 With the Ant object model created in bug 44343 I could see having a preference page/view action where the user could choose the set of attributes they wish to have displayed. For type elements such as ""path"" I have switched them to display the id of the element instead of the relatively useless ""path"" as the display name. Post 3.0 we will need to devise a means for the user to customize which attributes/values are displayed in the outline view. I'd like to discuss options/chances this feature to be implemented for 3.1release. Thank you. Eugene, do you have thoughts on how this could be presented to the user for configuration? Darin, the more I think about it the more I believe it should be something assimple as possible. Based on my experience with outlines implemented in Anteditor, XMLBuddy, new Eclipse structured editor and XMLSpy, the most convenientone is how it is implemented in XMLBuddy. So, by default it should show valuesfrom all element attribues (as much as you can fit to the screen). You may addsome simple configuration to exclude attributes based on patterns or xpath-likeexpression (elementName@attributeName), but it seems that it may not be necessary. By the way, have you looked at new structured editor? If I'm not mistaken it isused for XML and JSP editing in WTP platform. It would make more sence to addnice outline and quick outline (a la Ctrl-O in Java editor) to some generic XMLeditor and then have Ant-specific extension on top of it. In the 3.1 timeline there will be no chance to move to another implementation.More thinking on this...I really don't see how many of the labels will be readable with all the attribute information? What about presenting the attributes as children of the node? Darin, presenting attributes next to element name (as oppose to child nodes intree) bring a better experience and making tree view more intuitive and quick innavigation. I'll attach few screenshots to illustrate this. Created attachment 17523Current Ant editor outline Created attachment 17524Outline view for XMLBuddy XML editor Thank you for the pictures.I agree we can improve on providing some better labels for nodes (such as jar).But the XMLBuddy example you gave...Bob is not showing all of the attributes. He is picking some set that he has defined as important (at least from what I can tell from the pictures...I have no used XMLBuddy).For example, how is it decided to show ""javac yes""? You are right, he is showing oly first attribute and I believe it was not reallygood idea. You should concatenate values from all attributes as long as theresult string is not longer then some reasonable limit. In most of the casesuser can guess attribute names for those values from the context and moreover itis not necessary to see attribute names in the outline, they just adds anunneeded noise, because the whole point of outline is to present some structuraloverview for quick to increase navigatability. So then really there is no difference between the Eclipse presentation and the XMLBuddy presentation. Sorry I am not convinced that a huge ""attribute"" label would help most users. Can you at least make it configurable? E.g. show attribute values + max numberof attributes to show. You can also add configuration setting to show attributenames. This way it should serve majority of users and also relatively easy toimplement.In my experience, especially in Ant build xml's most important attributes apearsfirst following by the rest of attributes. Sorry but this is not a priority for 3.1 Darin, do you think it would make sence to add support for XML editors (ant,maven, pde, plain xmls) to the core platform (post 3.1) and then allow to extendcore editor with specific features (like you have in the current ant editor)? Anyway we could possibly reduce the duplication of effort would be a win for all. If a generic base, extensible XML editor becomes available I would be the first to be interested in adopting it for the Eclipse Ant support. But who would work that magic to make generic extensible XML to appear in coreplatform? As I believe you are aware there is the web tooling project that has a XML editor. I would hope that in the future this code would mature and naturally migrate down...with pushes from the Eclipse community of course...myself included in that community. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but XML editor in WTE is based on a ""structurededitor"" model, which is probably not suitable for a lightweight XML editor forcore platform. Currently I can hardly see that XML editor from WTE could bepromoted to the platform level.Compare this functionality with XML support in IDEA. It has just enoughfeatures. Smart behavior (indentation, autoinsert, auto close, etc), completion,validation and outline. As of now 'LATER' and 'REMIND' resolutions are no longer supported.Please reopen this bug if it is still valid for you.

37933	[plan item] Improve file encoding support	"Re: Non-uniform file encodings in the Eclipse PlatformMany worthwhile ideas here. Other comments...1. I assume in the ""basic algorithm"" steps are performed in order listed. Inthat case, steps 2 and 3 must be interchanged. The encoding interpreter mustalways be consulted first. Multiple encodings are possible with the same BOM.The result of (current) step 3 should be final. Otherwise, the BOM test shouldbe ignored unless it is inconsistent with the result of step 4 or 5.2. Encoding must be determined upon save as well as open. This determination mayrequire calling an output encoding interpreter, which you do not have in yourscheme. (Use case: User has an <?xml encoding declaration in an XML file andchanges text of the encoding attribute.) The editor should not be required totrack these changes character-by-character and blast off encoding changenotifications. In fact, the editor may not be aware of encoding at all. (Usecase: Rick Jellife has proposed an encoding declaration that would appear incomments at the beginning of a file.) Instead, an output encoding interpretershould be called at save time. IOW, the ""basic algorithm"" should be applied atsave time, too, using an encoding interpreter that operates on the Unicode textinstead of a byte stream.3. In light of the above, notifying of encoding changes seems of limited value,since may be re-determined at open/save time. Encoding should be discovered whenit is needed. Notification may be counter-productive, leading editors to takeactions they should not be taking, like calling setCharset().4. setEncoding() should be removed and the basic algorithm should be thedescription of how getEncoding() works. setEncoding() is a potential source ofproblems. For example, if setEncoding() is called on an open resource and theresource is then saved and closed, the resource cannot be re-opened successfullyunless the encoding set is remembered. This makes it a resource property, butthere is already a resource property that may contain an encoding and the twomay be in conflict. What is a valid use of setEncoding()?5. It should be possible for an editor to have associated encodinginterpreter(s), so that the user is not forced to set the encoding interpreterand the editor separately. It is highly likely that the user will not be awareof the encoding interpreter feature and will not correctly set it in advance ofhaving encoding problems. In fact, users seem to have problems learning how toset editors associated with extensions, and they already know what an editor is.Likewise, editors should not have to establish their own encoding interpretersprogrammatically.6. What is the use/purpose of isDefaultEncoding()? There may be several""defaults"". If anyone cares that a resource is not using the workspace-levelencoding, they should stop caring.7. Workspace-level, resource-level and interpreter-determined are requirements,but I am not convinced there are use cases to support directory-level encoding,and they do add overhead. If the feature exists, someone may find it useful, ifthat's the threshhold. I'll give a couple high level comments, though not an exhaustive list (just wanted to document some main things first). 1. I agree with Bob's comment that the BOM step should be done first, but my memory of the standards is that step should be final, if there is a BOM. That is, I thought the BOM was definitive. I'm not aware of cases where ""Multiple encodings are possible with the same BOM"". Bob, perhaps you can explain?2. Encoding (interpreters) definitely needs to be associated with content-type, not file extension. That seems to be assumed, understood by everyone, but just wanted to add my voice to the importance of that. 3. While an ""output"" interpreter would also be necessary, I think some token remembering the encoding used during input (or the last output) is required too. For one thing, if a 3 byte BOM (for UTF-8) is detected during read, its only polite to maintain that when written. For a second thing, which does depend on the token being ""kept up to date"" with notifications, it is possible that someone can paste text into a document that ""violates"" the encoding. Some well behaved editors might want to give some warning about that. 4. I might be explicit that the above comment assumes EncodingMemento (my name for the token :) should be associated not only with the IFile/Resouce, but also the IDocument. It is, after all, possible to save/copy a document independently of its original resource. In those cases the encoding token should ride along. 5. Something that seems missing from the spec is the association of IANA encoding names and Java encoding names. I suggest this be provided at a ""base"" level since 1) there's some ambiguities, 2) its dependent on VM and platform, and 3) should be a ""base"" preference that allows users to control that association, when needed. (Most users don't need to do this, but some do, and for those that do, there's no alternative workaround).6. I suspect there's a few well known interpreters that should be included as part of the base support: XML, at least. HTML, JSP, CSS also come to mind. Others?7. The spec also doesn't mention how conflict resolution between interpreters is handled. I suspect that if the ""well known"" ones were included as base support, there'd be little need beyond a warning message in the log file, but if, for example, everyone needs to re-invent an XML interpreter, there'd be plenty of opportunity for conflict and users may desire a choice as to which was used (which would be unfortunate). 8. Also not well covered in the spec is exception handling. From experience, its easy for a file (e.g. an XML file) to specify an encoding but that some character(s) in the file don't actual use that encoding, and a ""MalFormedInput"" exception will be raised. Some mechanism is then needed to allow users and/or client code to ""override"" whatever the ""default"" behavior should be. For example, an editor might want to give the user a choice to ""use default"" or pick another encoding to try. 9. The above point reminds me that in Java 1.4 there's an encoding setting that allows different behavior on encoding errors during input. One option throws an exception, the other substitutes '?' for unreadable characters (well, actually, they say they make an attempt to ""guess"" what the character is, but I'm not sure that's very accurate). The point being that some parallel setting should exist with base Eclipse support, which would then ""pass through"" to the underlying Java support. There's a similar situation with encoding errors on output, but a little worse. Even with 1.3, invalid characters are written as '?' instead of automatically throwing an exception, and some care is needed to handle invalid characters on output. The degree of care, I suggest, should also be ""settable"" by client code.  <Pyinson Data Over Head> Actually, WRT 3b, the determination is trivial enough if you try the translationand it throws. <Pyinson Data Over Head> See bug 3970 for a request to allow configurable line delimeters.If we allow this, it should be supported at the same granularity as the encoding settings (see Kai's comment). A new revision of the improved file encoding proposal has been made availableoff the Platform/Core web page:http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/platform-core-home/dev.html#plan_currentComments are welcome and should be made on the Platform/Core development list(platform-core-dev@eclipse.org) or this PR. While I appreciate the desire to simplify usage, I feel the suggested new plan (per-project encodings, with some attempt to discover encodings automatically) is a step backwards from the previous one (per-project, folder, and file encoding settings).First, there are good reasons to have documents with multiple encodings in a single project.  For example, suppose I want to ship a product on Windows, Mac, and UNIX.  I have README or other files with some requirements for non-ASCII characters.  For Windows, I might want to use the Windows variant of Latin-1, CP 1252.  For Mac, I might want to use Mac Roman.  For UNIX, I might use ISO Latin-1.  I might also have Japanese variants in Shift-JIS, Chinese in Big-5, and other Asian variants.  These variants are necessary, because a large number of sites do not have Unicode system locales - many do not even have Unicode locales installed.Second, note that discovering an encoding by reading a file is difficult, and potentially expensive (for files not marked with Unicode BOMs).  How much of a file would one read before deciding one knew the encoding?  What if my README file contained 2K or more of 7-bit ASCII text before a section that contained some symbols, or some accented or Asian characters?Third, the proposal seems to assume that certain file types imply certain encodings - notably, that XML should be in UTF-8.  This is not always the case.  There are times when we want to use Latin-1 or even 7-bit ASCII for XML (using XML character references for all characters outside those ranges), for compatibility with transport mechanisms and older code that cannot handle UTF-8.  As an extreme case, consider sending an XML document through a legacy protocol that is not 8-bit clean. <Pyinson Data Over Head> Created attachment 8384Proposed Contribution to handle encoding based on a file's contentThis zip file contains 7 projects, but only one is the 'primary' one,com.ibm.encoding.resource.

Closing. Improve file encoding support. Eclipse 2.1 uses a single global file encoding setting for reading and writing files in the workspace. This is problematic; for example, when Java source files in the workspace use OS default file encoding while XML files in the workspace use UTF-8 file encoding. The Platform should support non-uniform file encodings.

47389	Use of deprecated API from IActivityManager	IActivityManager.match(String, Set) has been deprecated to be replaced with isMatch(String, Set) Changed all of our calls to IActivityManager.match to IActivityManager.isMatch Please verify. Looks like the UI team has changed their mind on this one if one can tell from the integration build and nightly build compile errors...:-(We will have to adjust (maybe) once the build appears. So now (I20031125) both methods are marked as deprecated.Doug can we please get some direction on this? I have nothing to do with this work -- besides the occasional service as a sounding board.  I committed the fixes yesterday as a favour to Chris McLaren, who was having network difficulties.  I also do the builds now for platform-ui -- which is why my name has been all over this.  However, Chris McLaren and Kim Horne are the ones you want. Chris, Kim: please advise Darin and Jared as to the status of the deprecated API in IActivity and IActivityManager.  Thank you. i beleive kim has already sent information to jared on this. i know she has communicated with konrad already reagarding help's usage.basically, we want clients to be able to get out of the business of worrying about matching patterns and so forth. to find out if an identifier is enabled one uses:getActivityManager().getIdentifier(someidentifier).isEnabled().(ps. the return from getIdentifier is an instance of IIdentifier, a facility which allows you to register for changes against this identifier's enabled state, which is handy..) Fixed up in LaunchConfigurationManager, LaunchConfigurationTreeContentProvider, and BreakpointsViewContentProvider. Please verify, DarinW. Actually... there have been more changes.  Nothing too serious, though.  I'mattaching a patch (to be applied at the top level of org.eclipse.debug.ui) thatshould address it. Created attachment 7035Patch for org.eclipse.debug.ui What plugins do I need from CVS for this patch to compile?Also, what is the reasoning behind the extra level of indirection that's been introduced? Those extra lines of code everywhere we refer to the activity support seem like excessive crud. org.eclipse.ui.workbench should be sufficient.As to the motive...we're trying to keep IWorkbench bloat to a minimum.  Chrismay have further insight... 'excessive crud'.. ahh, i just can't win these days..i agree that getting these support classes is a level of indirection, but in a way its relieving to me in the sense i don't have to battle with anyone on what goes into IWorkbench* etc. (i was told) we want to start using IAdaptable on major workbench interfaces as part of our API evolution strategy. A number of these workbench interfaces, in spite of javadoc recommending otherwise, are implemented by other clients and subsequently adding methods is always a pain. therefore, there two issues contributing to indirection:1. IWorkbenchActivitySupport as the basis to get the activity manager and do other activity related things (which i like)2. the fact that an instance of IWorkbenchActivitySupport is only gained via getAdapter (which i could go either way on) *** Bug 47974 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** (I understand that it's not your call but) I'm inclined to say that if someone implements an interface they're told not to, it's the same as accessing an internal package. They do so at their own risk and should just have to update their code if they get broken. Maybe that's too idealistic. :-)The getAdapter strategy seems wrong to me. It makes the interface smaller at the great expense of API usability. How are clients supposed to know that they can get an IActivityManager from the workbench? Even if it is added to the JavaDoc on the interface (which kind of defeats the purpose of keeping the interface small), a client using code assist will never know that this functionality is available. If everyone followed this practice, code assist would basically be useless. To really find everything that's available on a type, we'd have to open the type in an editor and read the type comments.I've updated our code in the places indicated by Kim's patch. Thanks, Kim. Fixed in LaunchConfigurationManager, LaunchConfigurationTreeContentProvider, BreakpointsViewContentProvider, BreakpointsViewEventHandler, and LaunchAsAction.Please verify, DarinS. You are right in that it is not my call, because if it was I'd change it and break them. (As well as resist all the arguments '..but *I* really need to because blah blah blah..' :)IAdaptable does solve the problem by introducing weak typing, and with it comes some disadvantages like the ones you mentioned. I'm not quite sure how we document what interfaces we support through this mechanism. I'm going to add Nick Edgar to this to throw in his two cents. (IAdaptable is a lot like IUnknown from the COM world. In COM you will often find interfaces simply to enumerate what other interfaces are available. I'm scared at the thought of introducing an IWorkbenchIndex interface to enumerate the interfaces available through IWorkbench.getAdapter) I don't have a problem with adding getActivitySupport() on IWorkbench.When we discussed using IAdaptable, I was really only focussing on the site interfaces (IWorkbenchSite, IWorkbenchPartSite) which tend to grow service interfaces.  The original intent of the site interfaces is that they would allow for an open-ended set of services, but they were never implemented that way (in favour of strong typing).  Unlike IWorkbench, IWorkbenchWindow and IWorkbenchPage, workbench parts (and their sites) tend to get nested.  There are both authorized and unauthorized examples of this in the SDK (e.g. MultiPageEditorSite vs. SearchViewSiteAdapter).  Ideally, this kind of nesting would be supported in an open way.  That is, the multipage editor support could be implemented using public API, and wouldn't require special dispensation to directly implement IEditorPartSite.  But we don't currently have a good story for supporting an open-ended set of services which can be nested. activityManager.isMatch(ext.getId(), disabledActivityIds) is still called in LaunchAsAction in HEAD.  There are also still references to getActivityManager() all over the place...  Nick, What other interfaces are (or are planned) to be available via IWorkbench*Site.getAdapter() for 3.0 (at least from our team..)? I hope I wouldn't be the only 'service interface' using this facility by the time 3.0 ships; it might seem a little out of place.Ideally, for the activities and contexts API I'd like to see this:in IWorkbench:IWorkbenchActivitySupport getWorkbenchActivitySupport();IWorkbenchContextSupport getWorkbenchContextSupport();in IWorkbenchWindow:IWorkbenchWindowContextSupport getWorkbenchWindowContextSupport();in IWorkbenchPage:IWorkbenchPageContextSupport getWorkbenchPageContextSupport();in IWorkbenchPartSite:IWorkbenchPartSiteContextSupport getWorkbenchPartSiteContextSupport();- OR -getAdapter(IWorkbenchPartSiteContextSupport.class) != null;Note that it is the context API's only that appear at the window, page, partsite levels - these provide services for activation of contexts. activity API's only appear at the workbench level (for instance, the method IActivityManager getActivityManager would be in the interface IWorkbenchActivitySupport - something one gets at the workbench level only) Sometimes I forget that updating a Bugzilla report doesn't automatically commit changes to CVS. :-) So with these changes I require HEAD for the ui plugins? Correct. Re comment #21:I don't want to single out activities or contexts as the only service using getAdapter either.  The way I think of it is that the general mechanism is to use getAdapter on the site interfaces, but that we currently provide convenience methods to get our services in a type-safe way.  If the convenience methods could get moved elsewhere, then that would simplify nesting of parts/sites.For the context support methods, is it really necessary to have separate interfaces for each of the different levels?  Could we not have something like:in IWorkbench:IActivitySupport getActivitySupport();IContextSupport getContextSupport();in IWorkbenchWindow:IContextSupport getContextSupport();in IWorkbenchPage:IContextSupport getContextSupport();in IWorkbenchPartSite:IContextSupport getContextSupport();- OR -getAdapter(IContextSupport.class); Verified code changes. 	2009-06-18 03:39:55	1245310000.0	resolved fixed	c768090	1245340000.0	java/org/apache/catalina/ha/session/DeltaManager.java

47216	Unexpected warning when launching Eclipse in Eclipse	Build 20031120After importing all Eclipse plug-ins in self-hosted workspace, the target platform got set to point at my SDK install (which I imported).Attempting to launch plugin Junit tests, I get notified that my workspace contains now twice as many plugins, is it ok to continue ?I have the impression that it automatically append the plugins from the target platform, which I don't need as I have them all in my workspace now. I don't recall this occurring before. It should realize that on the target platform, there is nothing more than what I have already in my workspace and should take precendece over it. As of two weeks ago, we turn on all external plug-ins by default.  This makes the new user's experience much smoother, since they won't be overwhelmed by the notion of a target platform right off the bat.  Another reason for turning them on all the time is for Dynamic classpaths to be able to work automagically without people having to visit the target platform page.Workspace plug-ins do take precedence over external plug-ins, and the behavior is as you would expect.  I see where you are coming from as to why we should notify you about all this in a dialog, since you don't care.  I personally did not want to have such a dialog.  However, we had requests to show it at least once and then people can turn it off indefinitely if they choose to. Understood Would be best to turn off the warning by default.  If an Eclipse veteran, like Philippe, was alarmed by it, I could only imagine how regular and new users might react :-) Fixed. 	2009-05-18 18:13:50	1242680000.0	resolved wontfix	36feee0	1243250000.0	java/org/apache/coyote/http11/Http11Processor.java

37929	[Plan Item] Improve UI scalability	"Improve UI scalability. Despite efforts to ensure UI scalability with a large base of available tools, the Eclipse workbench still intimidates many users with long menus, wide toolbars, and lengthy flat lists of preferences. This problem is acute in large Eclipse-based products. The Platform should provide additional ways for controlling workbench clutter, such as further menu and toolbar customizability, distinguishing between novice and advanced functions, supporting different developer roles, and more specific object contributions for particular file types. [Platform UI, Platform Debug, JDT UI] [Theme: User experience] *** Bug 36954 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** Hi,   I am glad after reading the Eclipse Project Draft 3.0 plan that in eclipse 3.0 that this bug going to be addressed, but I also want the people who is going to address this bug to provide api's to do the menu and toolbar customization(i.e, allow us to remove unwanted menu items programmatically).If you are just providing the option to customise the menubar,toolbar manually like how you do in customising perspective then it won't be useful because when we want to develop non-ide applications we should not give it to the hand of end user for the customisation rather we should remove the burden of the end user by removing unwanted menu item programmatically.MorPheus MorPheus, a better plan item to track for what you want is: Bug 36967  [RCP] [Plan Item] Enable Eclipse to be used as a rich client platform  I have made some comments on this issue in other bug reports. They focused on specific instances of the scalability/plugin co-existance problem relating to action contributions and help contributions. But the problems are more generic. I mention a possible approach to solving the problem which is based on perspectives that should be able to handle many of the problems. Here are links to the other PRs: bug #36968 and bug #36964. I also commented about how improved action contribution support can help the UIscalability story in bug 36968. Central to the UI scalability problem is that there are various places in the UIwhere too many ""irrelevent"" choices are shown.  Several of these are listed inthe initial comment above:* toolbar / menu actions* preferences pagesPerhaps the ""abstract task"" idea I described in bug 36968 could also be appliedto preferences pages to help group preferences or even to hide them.  One idea:- Suppose we have an option to display preference pages only for abstract tasksthat have been used in a particular session.- Another way would be to have a filtering mechanism that could filter thedefault list of preferences according to the user's preferred set of tasks. Additional issues relevent to UI scalability can be found in bug 36967 (EnableEclipse as a Rich-Client Platform). FYI: A draft proposal for 'Contexts' has been posted to the Platform UI proposals page at:http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/platform-ui-home/docs.html.It is expected that contexts will form *part* of the solution to this plan item. Please also look at coolitem ""bloat"".  For example, in 3.0 M3, ""Add CVS Repository"" appears by itself in a coolitem.  that action should have a way of placing itself after the ""New.."" dropdown.  (Or better yet, it should be a new wizard, but that's another topic).In general, toolitems should be grouped by function, not by which plug-in contributed the action. Please consider bug 21652 as a bug this bug depends on because it is also a UI scalability problem. A copy of the posting to platform-ui-dev malinglist to explain why bug 21652 is an UI scalability issue can be found in bug 21652 comment 3:https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=21652#c3 I find the Workbench->Colors, Workbench->Fonts, and Workbench->KeyBindings preference pages lacking in innovation. These pages are not going to scale well for large application.  But, besides scaling, it's unintuitive.If I want to change the colors Internet Explorer uses for web pages, I don't open up the OS control panel and bring up some global list of colors.  I go to the localized preference dialog for that application.  Fonts, colors, and keybindings should be the same way.  Each application (e.g. Java Editor) should show its subset of fonts, colors, and keybindings which apply to it, in the place where the user would most likely expect those settings to be.I am not commenting on the services that are available in the workbench, just on the UI presentation of those services. They should not be directly served up to the user in a single complex UI.The ""Syntax"" tab on the Java Editor preferences page is a great example of what applications should do.  Fonts and keybindings should be done the same way whenever possible. For keybindings, the workbench could provide a reusable preference page which would be scoped to the editor's context.  The other pages would probabaly be up to the client to create so that an editor preview could be shown.thanks. agree - the workbench has added base support for color and font management and overriding and should not force downstream users of this to have to edit their colors in the workbench preferences.this is optional, and you may want to use but it is more likely that you would put your color+font editing in a localized place as mentioned I have to disagree with you Randy.  The initial drive for this color page was infact from our downstream customers who were attempting to reduce the number ofpreference pages they had to ship.  Putting all colour settings in a singleplace seems far more scalable to me than a preference page per app.  And for mepersonally, knowing I can go to one place to change my colors instead ofspelunking through hundreds of preference pages is a relief.Having said this... the place for this page is not under the Workbench page. I'm not sure where the right place is...  Kim, allowing the editor to get rid of its appearance preference page is an unrealistic goal.  How close are you to allowing the Java Editor to delete their appearance preference Tab? <tongue in cheek> Is there to be a global ""Displayed Tab Width"" preference page? print margin column? Show line numbers? </tongue in cheek>The user does not think in terms of ""let me change colors/fonts everywhere"", but instead ""how can I change the Java Editor look&feel""?I actually agree that it is sometimes nice to be able to view all colors in one place.  But, especially with keybindings, there should be a way to filter what I am seeing. Perhaps limit the keybinding to a ""context hierarchy"" (or colors to a specific editor). For example, just show me keybindings for when I am ""Editing Java Source"". Or perhaps even allow plug-ins to *reuse* the entire keybinding preference page under their editor's preferences branch, and have it ""rooted"" at the appropriate context for that editor. You've got a good point - we can't eliminate all of a plugins preference pages. The idea is reduction, not elimination.The colors/fonts page currently can be limited to showing the colors of oneeditor... provided the implementor of that editor puts all of the colors andfonts used by that editor into their own category.  This is the intended use ofcategories.  Carve up the font/color space into reasonable chunks and yet keepthem all in one spot. Categories sound great and they are needed in the keybindings page too.I don't foresee any reductions taking place.  The JDT team would be making a mistake if they removed the color portion of their preference page simply because those settings appear in the global color page. Users will look at the Java Editor page first, especially 2.1 users. See also Bug 58713 (Colors and fonts preferences inconsistent).If you have colors for the Java editor in two places, which takes precedence?Also, if you have 1000 plug-ins installed, each needing their own color settings, putting them all in one big tree or list seems like a very non-scalable solution to me. Added support for Activities, more flexible object contributions, exspression language support (from Dirk), content types (from Platform Core) and contextsMarking as fixed.

42579	Eclipse allows setting a source folder's parent as output folder, which wipes out source code	"It's possible to select a source folder's parent as the output folder, asdescribed below. This has the majorly annoying side-effect of wiping out yoursource code. Viz:Suppose you have a project named MyProject.- Create a source folder MyDir/src as a source folder. This will set the newdefault output directory to MyProject/bin. - Create a class, package com.abs.stc, name Hello, in this directory.Now change the source folder to /MyDir/src and the output folder to /MyDir asfollows: - Right click on the project and select Properties->Java Build Path->Source.- click on Allow output folders for source folders. Click on Output folder,(expand the source folder MyProject/MyDir/src if necessary), press Edit, clickon ""Specific Output Folder"" and change it to MyDir. Click OK. - You'll get a message about not being able to nest MyProject/MyDir/src insideMyProject/MyDir. Make this message go away by changing the Default output folderat the bottom of the dialog box from MyProject/bin to MyProject. (This isprobably where this bug should get fixed; it shouldn't let you do this.) - Click OK. You'll get a message box asking if it's OK to remove the oldgenerated sources from the old output folder; click Yes. BOOM! If you're usingEclipse 3.0 or 2.1.1, this will immediately wipe out your source directory.(If you're using 2.1, you get a reprieve; your source directory won't get wipeduntil try to run Hello.java when you get an error about the main class not beingfound.)

Funky color but not bad for the current default color scheme.Also, could you please change the presentation layer from 6 to 0. Using a high layer for the whole line means that no other annotation that uses background highlighting will show up.We (Text) do not yet apply background colors according to presentation layers but will fix that for the milestone build. Using layer 0 would then nicely go together with ""mark found occurrences"" and such. Checked in both Erich and Kai's suggestions.Please verify, DarinW. Reopening to reassign. Fixed for verification.

46998	Generalize Type: Cancel does not seem to work [refactoring]	200311191. create a selfhosting eclipse workspace that has all plugins as binary except jdt.core from HEAD.2. open CompilationUnitSorter, and select the first parameter from method 'sort'.3. Invoke 'Generalize Type'. Press cancel.4. The cancel button does not seem to have an effect, the operation finished the calculation.The dialog should probably close as a reaction to cancel (The cancel button is directly on the dialog) As always pressing the cancel button when an operation is active cancel the operation without closing the dialog. This is consistent with the other wizards/refactorings we have.That the Cancel button doesn't work is my fault. I forgot to tell you that you have to check the progress monitor form time to time if it got canceled. If so the code has to throw an operation cancel exception.So a typical code sequence looks like this.pm.worked('some work');if (pm.isCanceled()) {  // do some clean-up if necessary  throw new OperationCanceledException();}Since your refactoring does some expensive computing outside of searching (searching supports canceling) you should add that code at appropriate places (may be after each CU you processed).If the fix is trivial, please provide a patch for M5 Scanning our code shows that we don't check the pm.isCanceled either. So this seem to be a more general problem. Since we have other refactorings that don't honor cancel well, there is no need to fix it for M5.

But that can bea problem/feature of the filesystem, if there is a delay between when the datais saved and when the data is available to read.We should ask releng. I have removed the working directory tests from M5. The LaunchConfigurationWorkingCopy implementation implements doSave() in arunnable (in this case), which means the saved directory attribute may not bewritten to disk by the time the launch occurs. But, it's not clear that itmatters. Does the working directory for a new launch get initialized from thebits in the configuration file or can it just come from the LaunchConfigurationinstance? The getInfo().getAttribute() calls should get the values from memory(the up-to-date and correct values). If they come from the configuration file ondisk, then we should add synchronization between the doSave0() and the launch()so that we don't launch until the save to disk is finished. Comments? When the launch configuration is written, we clear it from the cache of launch config infos. That means the old info is in the cache until the new one is written. This could be the timing issue.There are two ways for us to remove the info from the cache - see LaunchManager.launchConfigurationChanged(...). This method is called for a local (non-shared) config when the file is written, or when a resource delta indicates a shared config file has changed. The timing on this could be problematic (especically for shared configs).We need to ensure the cache is not accessed while writting a config, to be safe. Perpahs we can synch on it somehow. Darin's comments make sense. Upon further inspection, I see that the runnable doSave() is synchronous, so it's not inherent in our code to cause a timing issue there. I'll look at the cache. Thanks for the comments. I verified that, at least on the Mac platform, the sequence of calls that write the new config and clear the cache are all synchronous. They even occur all in the same thread so there appears no way to request the new config and get it from cache accidently due to any timing issues. The change notification is all occuring after the config has been marked as changed. We could still synch on the cache/file update, but I'm not optimistic that will fix the problem. I still wonder if the file stream is completely written in the underlying system before we read it back in the launch sequence. The input stream stream is closed, but I don't see where the output stream is flushed. That's my next place to poke around. Tracing the doSave() code to the bottom, the platform uses a FileOutputStream towrite the updated launch configuration out to a file. FileOutputStream has noflush() method and the superclass does nothing on flush(). The documentationclaims that all buffered output is written to the file when theFileOutputStream.close() method is called, which is called in the platformimplementation. So, this takes it down a level into the specific JVM platformimplementation. I'll look around a bit, but we may also want to instrument thecode and put the test back in place so that we can verify my theories on thetest machines. For example, I claim that all of the actions and notificationsare synchronous because they happen in the same thread. We could log some outputon a test failure that validates that assumption. Ideas?

Created attachment 6866the file in which the error occured There is a case where the source positions of the string literal are boggus. Iwill track it down. Thanks a lot again for your help. It is really appreciated. Did you touch the line containing:append(""Attempting to reload Subscriber Template with name: "" + identifier);I tried to reproduce with the file you attached, but it could be convertedwithout a problem. So something is wrong with the position of the string whileediting it. I don't know why, but it seems that an offset of 1 is introduced wrongly in thestring literal positions. In your last example, the literal should be:""Attempting to reload Subscriber Template with name: ""but it is:Attempting to reload Subscriber Template with name: "" With a trailing space.The former is a valid string literal, not the latter. I am investigating how thestring literal can end up with invalid positions while the compilation unit isconverted.Don't hesitate to attach other code snippets if you get it again.

46986	[ErrorHandling] [RCP] SafeRunnable in JFace opens an error dialog	"The class org.eclipse.jface.util.SafeRunnable opens an error dialog if the runnable it contains throws an exception. There are cases (e.g bug 46960) where an exception in this runnable can happen frequently. I got 137 error dialogs when I was reproducing this problem. Would logging the error be sufficient in this case? Otherwise, some mechanism to avoid poping up multiple dialogs at the same time should be employed. You can suppress this by using ignoreErrors=true in your SafeRunnable. The ""you"" in this case is StructuredViewer/TreeViewer. The SafeRunnable is used by the TreeViewer during label updating (doUpdateItem) and the StructuredViewer (refreshItem). Sorry for not making that clearer in the original description.When an error occurs for a single item, an error dialog is presented. If multiple items have errors, a dialog is presented for each. In the rare case where this happens, you can end up with a lot of dialogs. I don't know if logging is the best alternative since the user would like to know that an error occurred but a single dialog would be sufficient. Would it be possible to accumulate the exceptiuons and prompt the user once. If not, would some other means of error notification be possible. Closing 137 error dialogs takes a while. This is a general problem with SafeRunnables. We have many of them in parts which open dialogs (AbstractPartSelectionTracker, StructuredViewer, etc.). The other option is to write to the log only but this give no user feedback.If we are going to change how this works then we are changing this everywhere.What we might consider (post 3.0) is some sort of error collecting dialog like we currently have for jobs.I am going to mark this asan enhancement and consider it post 3.0 as it would represent a fairly far reaching new feature and we want to minimize functionality changes. Reopening With the change in bug 58845 to not remove failing listeners, this situationcould be made much worse.  I've decided to go ahead and make the default beignoreErrors=true, so we won't get error dialogs for free, but apps can stillreverse this decision if needed.  Core will still log any error in Platform.run. Fixed. We had to back out of this change for 3.0.  See bug 66733 for details.SafeRunnable.ignoreErrors is false by default.Should find some way of routing this to an app-level event handler (somethingakin to WorkbenchAdvisor.eventLoopExeption). Not for 3.1.  Reassigning to Stefan since he has recently become passionateabout this issue <g>. This is not only annoying, it's incorrect. Opening a dialog is part of amethod's contract, and dialogs are not permitted in most places whereSafeRunnable is used. *** Bug 87721 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** See also bug 87721 comment #4:""With the recent changes for bug 49497, the app could configure a different saferunnable runner using SafeRunnable.setRunner(ISafeRunnableRunner).See also JFaceUtil in the workbench.""Susan, is bug 103295 another duplicate of this?

The reporter of that bug never responded to the final question, but it would seem that the desire was to be able to set up a SafeRunnable runner that would also work with InternalPlatform.run.  Which I think is what you are saying also in comment #12.  To me, that implies work on the runtime side, to allow a similar way for apps to set up the runnable runners.  JFace can't do this since it is supposed to be independent of the runtime.  I will move bug #103295 to runtime for comment.  I'm not sure what is left ""to-do"" on this bug.  Are we considering setting a different kind of SafeRunnableRunner in the IDE to avoid multiple dialogs? (In reply to comment #13)> To me, that implies work on the runtime side, to allow a similar way for apps> to set up the runnable runners.  JFace can't do this since it is supposed to be> independent of the runtime.  Maybe I'm missing something, but if any runnable runner calls ISafeRunnable.handleException() - btw this is required if you implement ISafeRunnableRunner -, the default implementation in SafeRunnable will open a dialog. To fix this, we need additional API in SafeRunnable so that applications can intercept the exception and do with it what they want. I see...I was distracted by the suggestion to fix the problem by replacing the SafeRunnableRunner.  Using the runner to avoid the problem only works when SafeRunnableRunner is used.Just to make sure I understand the problem.  SafeRunnable is expressly documented as an abstract implementation of ISafeRunnable that opens a message dialog on error.  Implementors have to subclass this to provide the run() behavior, and presumably can implement handleException however they wish.But there are so many built-in uses of SafeRunnable in JFace itself that we need to provide a hook into the handleException behavior that would be set at the SafeRunnable level, ie an exception handler that can be assigned statically to SafeRunnable, and if none is assigned we can revert to the default (message dialog) behavior.  Does that sound about right? Yes this sounds right to me.  Ideally, for RCP applications, there should be just one place e.g. in the WorkbenchAdvisor where they define what happens with unexpected errors.  Remember that the IDE is just another RCP application...This could be another aspect of JFace configured by the Workbench by calling API on Policy.java. Susan, should I just take this bug? sure, it sounds like you have a good grasp from the RCP point of view.I was thinking the new API to set the exception handler would be called in JFaceUtil.initializeJFace(), where the other Policy calls are made.  Note there are calls to SafeRunnable as well (setRunner), so I was leaning toward making the exception handler setter static API on the SafeRunnable class.  The interface itself could be named IExceptionHandler, or perhaps more specifically ISafeRunnableExceptionHandler.  That's where I was headed... SafeRunnable now opens a non-modal dialog, collecting errors if necessary.  This avoids the multiple error dialog case, and will not spin the event loop at inappropriate times.See bug 178906.*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 178906 *** "	2009-04-07 17:14:51	1239140000.0	resolved fixed	f497f12	1239200000.0	java/org/apache/jasper/Constants.java java/org/apache/jasper/compiler/PageInfo.java java/org/apache/jasper/xmlparser/ParserUtils.java

Job manager shutdown doesn't catch jobs that have alreadystarted (it invokes cancel on them but there is no guarantee they will respond). When these jobs finish the UI is scheduling an update job.I think the solution is for UI to unhook its job listener before shutting downthe job manager.  Otherwise it will fail when it tries to run the update job. Moving to UI.  Remove your job listener(s) before calling IJobManager.shutdown. The update jobs are no longer needed anyway (the display is about to be disposed). The problem goes a bit deeper.  Shutting down the job manager from the UI willbreak other plugins that try to run jobs during shutdown.  You could argue thatpeople shouldn't be doing this, but of course it turns out they are (see bug47051 for example).  UI should still unhook all of their job listeners beforeexiting (since the UI job listener invariably launches a UI job that will try toasyncExec in the disposed display).  We may need to reconsider the job managershutdown strategy post M5 (since Equinox runtime has its own multi-stageshutdown story). *** Bug 47095 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** We now only disconnect at shutdown and allow the job manager to do it.Also all of our done listeners that support our workbench UI jobs are doing a test for workbench shutdown before rescheduling.

39396	cannot find source if if source != output folder	"Create a new Java project with a source folder named src and an output foldernamed bin.  If you create a class in src, you cannot edit the class file in bin.When you try to open the class file, the following appears in the Class File Editor:Source not foundTher is no souce file attached to the class file Test.class The output folder is not supposed to be used as a normal working folder (hence the name bin or output folder). The error message of the editor is correct since there isn't any source attached with the file in the output folder. Class files in the output folder aren't always derived from a Java file. They could simply be copied from some resource folders to the output folder.No action planned to change this behaviour for 3.0. The current behavior is inconsistent with two scenarios:  (1) if the outputfolder is the same as the source folder in a Java project, the user cansuccessfully open the class file and the editor will show the source inread-only mode.  (2) class files within jars on the classpath and class fileswithin classes folders in the project can be opened.  If there is no sourceattached, then the class file editor will show the results of introspection.The class file editor should handle the case where the output folder isdifferent from the source folder.  It should first attempt to resolve the sourceby looking in the source folders of the project -- if the source is found itshould display it as read-only as in case (1) above.  If the source cannot befound, it should display the introspection results as in case (2) above.Also, the previous description in this bug report was incorrect.  Currently ifyou attempt to open a class file in a bin folder, the message you receive is,""The classfile is not on the classpath"" and no editor is opened.  This is boundto be confusing since intuitively the class file is on the classpath. Regardless, this issue should be fixed by enabling the class file editor tohandle this case, not by simply changing the message. Asking Text for comments. My opinion is still that no action is required for 3.0 given what is else on the plan. Using I20071127-0800 I still see the inconsistency i.e. source is returned if output folder == source folder.JDT Core provides the source (or doesn't). Daniel, what action do you expect for this issue? >Daniel, what action do you expect for this issue?Currently, if source and output folder are the same then JDT Core finds the source for the class file.

46298	Aspectj generate code does not de-compile cleanly.	"<Pyinson Data Over Head> Created attachment 6699Source to re-produce problem. Created attachment 6700Source to re-prodcue problem. Created attachment 6701Decompiled output. Created attachment 6702Decompiled output. Adding this to 1.2 plan as a placeholder to spend some effort to see what we can do if anything to improve existing decompiler toleration of ajc generated code.The long term solution is to build an AspectJ decompiler. This is not currently in plan (and wouldn't actually help Ron here since I recall from discussion that the reason for decompiling is to understand what ajc is generating, and an AspectJ decompiler should decompile back to AspectJ source). Anywhere we generate handlers, we need the load/store combo to keep the decompilers happy (see the JRocket fix)... Yuck, this is a nasty problem - nastier than the JRockit issue as it isnt really related to *generating* new handlers so much as instrumenting existing ones.  Help, jim, can you tell me what you think about this...Here is what I have found.Here is a simple version of Rons code that shows the problem:class ExceptionCatcher {  RuntimeException re = new RuntimeException();  public void catchException() {    try {      throw re;    } catch (Exception e) { }  }	  public static void main(String[] args) {    new ExceptionCatcher().catchException();  }}aspect ExceptionHandler {  before(): handler(*) {    System.out.println(""Starting before block"");  }}If I compile this, I am basically adding advice to the start of the catch block.  If I jad the resulting ExceptionCatcher then it fails as Ron describes.  A javap -c ExceptionCatcher reports:public void catchException();  Code:   0:   aload_0   1:   getfield        #16; //Field re:Ljava/lang/RuntimeException;   4:   athrow   5:   nop   6:   invokestatic    #38; //Method ExceptionHandler.aspectOf:()LExceptionHandler;   9:   invokevirtual   #41; //Method ExceptionHandler.ajc$before$ExceptionHandler$1$768387dd:()V   12:  pop   13:  return  Exception table:   from   to  target type     0     5     5   Class java/lang/ExceptionNotice where the 'pop' instruction is.Now, if I try and create a piece of Java that simulates what ajc is doing:class ExceptionCatcher {  RuntimeException re = new RuntimeException();  public void catchException() {    try {      throw re;    } catch (Exception e) {       ExceptionHandler.aspectOf().ajc$before$ExceptionHandler$1$768387dd();    }  }	  public static void main(String[] args) {    new ExceptionCatcher().catchException();  }}And then I compile that with ajc (no aspect is included in the compilation step), then I get a new version of ExceptionCatcher that jads successfully.  The bytecode is:public void catchException();  Code:   0:   aload_0   1:   getfield        #16; //Field re:Ljava/lang/RuntimeException;   4:   athrow   5:   pop   6:   invokestatic    #27; //Method ExceptionHandler.aspectOf:()LExceptionHandler;   9:   invokevirtual   #30; //Method ExceptionHandler.ajc$before$ExceptionHandler$1$768387dd:()V   12:  return  Exception table:   from   to  target type     0     5     5   Class java/lang/ExceptionNotice that the pop instruction in this case is before the call to the aspect method.I had originally thought the fix might be to move the shadow start point for the handler by one instruction (over the pop) but that causes a bit of a mess in the harness tests. Right, some progress - I think I can see that the method I'm interested in is BcelShadow.prepareForMungers() which messes with the exception handler code, inserting the NOP amongst other things. After Miks demo earlier today at AOSD, I asked Erik what he thought about this bug.  He said:proposed fix:AspectJ should pattern match between START OF HANDLERpopSTART OF HANDLERpushif we expose the exception, we need to delete the pop if it's thereif we don't, we should just insert code _after_ the pop.=====I *hope* to get this in before 1.2 final. This turns out to be more complicated ... as these things do.prepareForMungers() looks at the shape of the handler and inserts a NOP (I assume to use as the shadow to munge).  I can adjust prepareForMungers() to insert the NOP after the POP (using what Erik described and optionally including the POP instruction when identifying a handler join point).  But if I do that then at the point we do the munging, I need to perhaps delete the POP depending on whether the exception is being used in the advice being woven.  I can determine if the exception is being used, but deleting the POP seems tricky.  At the point we do the munging the start of the shadow is the NOP, and jumping to a previous instruction seems to move me outside of the shadow - and I don't think I want to start affecting code 'surrounding' the shadow ??   I don't have a decompiler to play with, so all of these suggestions are untested.  You should be careful fixing this bug as the last thing we want is to generate truly invalid bytecode just to make broken decompilers happier.The first thing that I'd try is to call initializeArgVars() at the end of the ""else if (getKind() == ExceptionHandler) {"" block in prepareForMungers().  This call will force the use of a frame slot to hold the exception value and the added store instruction will mean that the value isn't kept on the stack during the advice.After doing this, you'll still have an ALOAD/POP combo just outside the shadow for cases where the exception isn't used in the original handler.  If this still bothers the decompiler, you can try to remove it at the end of prepareMungers().  At the end of that method there's a block for ""if (getKind().argsOnStack() && argVars != null) {"".  You could add a special case to the beginning of this block to check for an ExceptionHandler shadow type AND a first instruction outside the shadow that's a POP.  In that case you want to remove the POP and NOT generate the args. Ok - I've implemented a fix based around what Jim was suggesting.  (I must saythis seemed easier to do having 3 months more compiler experience than when Ilast posted on the bug!).  All changes in BcelShadow.prepareForMungers()We currently shove in a 'NOP' when preparing an exception handler for munging. This is to give us an anchor when we insert extra instructions that exposecontext for use in the advice.  This confuses the decompiler as it wants toeither see a POP or an ASTORE as the first instruction in the handler code.  SoI've removed the NOP and made it always do a STORE to stick the stack contentsinto a local variable - which we may or may not use the value of.  Effectivelywhere we were optionally storing the value on the stack (the caught exception),we now always store it but may not use it.Once the STORE is in the right place we rework the exception ranges to includeour new instruction. (They need to point to it rather than to the instructionafter it).The other piece of the fix is to repair the stack as we exit the handler. Normally we stick in an ALOAD after the advice so the stack is ready for use bythe actual code originally written in the catch block.  However, in the case weare looking at here, the first instruction in the real catch block is a POP asthe exception is never used.  It is redundant to generate an ALOAD and thenexecute a POP - and it confuses decompilers.  So in the case where we have donethis clever ASTORE business (i.e. we are a handler shadow), we check if the nextinstruction is a POP.  if it is then we don't generate the ALOAD and splat thePOP with a NOP (easier to replace the POP than remove it with all the targetermanagement that would be involved).If we now compile the sample program:class ExceptionCatcher {  RuntimeException re = new RuntimeException();  public void catchException() {    try {      throw re;    } catch (Exception e) { }  }	  public static void main(String[] args) {    new ExceptionCatcher().catchException();  }}aspect ExceptionHandler {  before(): handler(*) {    System.out.println(""Starting before block"");  }}We get this bytecode:public void catchException();  org.aspectj.weaver.MethodDeclarationLineNumber: length = 0x4   00 00 00 05  Code:   Stack=1, Locals=2, Args_size=1   0:   aload_0   1:   getfield        #16; //Field re:Ljava/lang/RuntimeException;   4:   athrow   5:   astore_1   6:   invokestatic    #39; //Method ExceptionHandler.aspectOf:()LExceptionHandler;   9:   invokevirtual   #42; //MethodExceptionHandler.ajc$before$ExceptionHandler$1$768387dd:()V   12:  nop   13:  return  Exception table:   from   to  target type     0     5     5   Class java/lang/ExceptionAt instruction #5 you can see the new ASTORE_1. At instruction #12 you can see where we replaced the POP with a NOP.In the exception table you can see the target is our new ASTORE_1.And it decompiles just fine.(I also fixed the common singleton version of the aspectOf() method so that itdecompiles cleanly - I haven't investigated decompilation of the variants ofthis method created when using per clauses)I'll close the bug when the fix is available.

46381	Need proper shutdown hook for cleaning up platform on termination.	<Pyinson Data Over Head> Can you describe a user scenario right now where the user has to manually deletethe .lock file?  We don't fail startup if the lock file exists, but only if wefail to open an exclusive channel on the lock file (using a java.nio lockingchannel). Two things:1) I see now that the use of nio locking channel is new and differs from 2.x, sothat's good that it no longer blocks startup.  I'm still getting used to thevarious changes in 3.0.  I note in a few experiments that the .lock file is notever deleted (3.0 M4) and looking at the code, its not clear it is even neededanymore.2) the fundamental problem is still the same - the finally{} clause is notexecuted if the runtime terminates in response to an external signal.  Theremaining 'shutdown()' activities will not be carried out.  I haven't done adetailed analysis to assertain whether any of the remaining shutdown activitiesare potentially data critical.  My assumption has been that they are (bettersafe than sorry :-). As you said yourself, there is no mechanism that is guaranteed to run in allcrash cases, so adding this hook would add false security.  I would suggest thatthe most common crashes are VM crashes, in which case the shutdown hook willlikely not run.In any event, there is no critical platform data persisted during pluginshutdown.  Lumping all plugin shutdowns into a shutdown hook in case a clientplugin has critical data to persist doesn't make sense.  We can't control howmuch time shutdown methods take, so we would be increasing the chance of theuser losing patience and killing the process without waiting for clean termination. I don't expect one to be able to catch ALL terminations, but one should be ableto catch all normal terminations.We have a very common usecase that involves the platform being launched at userlog-on and it is expected that it will be up all the while that the user islogged in.  In this scenario, the common way a user will 'exit' the platform isby logging off his/her account.   In this case, the JRE will recieve atermination signal from the operating system.This is NOT a VM crash.The user has every right to expect the code to respond appropriately to such asignal.  With eclipse 2.1, it does not.   With Eclipse 3 we have a chance to dothis correctly.Note that a shutdownhook is called even with _normal_ application exit as wellso it is appropriate to put normal shutdown code there.  Shutdown code thattakes a long time is at risk for premature termination only in the scenariowhere an external signal has been sent to the program and, if the code takes along time so that the user is prompted if he wants to 'end now' and he isimpatient.  That scenario is most likely only if the user has selected toexplicitely kill the process such as from the Task Manager.   None of that wouldhappen on a normal application exit and on a typical account logout the userwould likely be patient since users are used to applications needing to savedata when they quit.Plugin shutdowns should only be invoked during a shutdownhook if they have animplementation.  Also, it may make sense to register each plugin shutdown methodwith its own shutdown hook. I apologize for closing this bug a bit hastily.  It looked like you were tryingto solve a problem that didn't really exist.However, keep in mind that the application typically does all essential shutdownwork before exiting.  Plugin shutdown methods often do very little interestingwork.  For example, with the Workbench (IDE) application, persisting the UI andworkspace state is done before it exits.  If you are concerned about these casesyou should enter a similar bug report with the provider of the application (suchas Platform UI). If you are writing your own application, you may not beconcerned about this since you can handle it yourself. Also, another alternative would be to add a shutdown hook yourself whose onlyaction would be to ask the application to exit (for instance,PlatformUI.getWorkbench().close()). That would cause the platform to shutdownnormally (if there is enough time). Of course, one would have to avoid doingthat during normal shutdown, but that would be easy to ensure.This wouldn't require any changes to Eclipse, plug-ins' shutdown methods or tothe application itself. First off, I don't think plugin code should ever take responsibility forshutting down the platform.  That is just plain asking for trouble.Lets break the problem down like so:a) a java application can be terminated in one of the following ways:  1) code runs naturally to finish of main() execution.  In the platform's case,this corresponds to the natural termination of the runnable.run(applicationArgs)invocation in the snippet above.  In this scenario, the main thread continues,surrounding finally{} clauses are executed and shutdown hooks are executed.  2) code invokes System.exit(int).  Note that this can happen at any point andif so, the main thread is terminated, finally{} clauses are ignored but shutdownhooks are executed.  3) JRE recieves a friendly termination signal from the OS -> this is typicallywhat happens when the user 'logs out' of his OS account and is quite normal.  Inthis scenario, the main thread is terminated, finally{} clauses are ignored butshutdown hooks are executed.  4) Catastrophic termination:  really bad application crash / VM crash /unfriendly process termination / OS crash / power outage / God descends from theheavens.  In this scenario, the main thread is terminated, finally{} clauses areignored and shutdown hooks are probably ignored.So if you look across the 4 possible termination scenarios, we see that forcovering our patooties, the finally{} clause is good for 1 out of 4, whileshutdown hooks are good for 3 out of 4 (and may even still make it in someapplication or VM crash scenarios).b) Next, we ask the question:  Is there anything that the platform really needsto make sure it puts a best effort at doing when the system shuts down?  Anycritical steps that need completion, or states that need to be resolved?  If theanswer is 'yes', then based on point (a) the preferred strategy is to use ashutdown hook.  If the answer is 'no', then why do we have a finally{} clause here?c) Another question to ask is: What is the exact nature of thedesign-by-contract agreement between the platform and the Plugin.shutdown()method?  Is this method guaranteed to be called when the platform shuts down?  If so, then it should be invoked with a shutdown hook.  {A strategy one mightuse is, upon loading a plugin, check to see if the shutdown() method has beenoverridden (i.e. is a declared method of the particular plugin class) and if so,register it in a shutdownhook, otherwise do not).  If the answer is thatplugin.shutdown() is NOT guaranteed to be called when the platform shuts down,then why do we even have this method?This is a critically important thing to be made clear here.  If a plugindeveloper can not rely on the shutdown() method as a place to handle datacritical shutdown actions, then he/she needs to know to instead register theirown shutdown hook. See bug 298416 for a related topic.  We now have a shutdown hook that does a best effort to persist the framework state if the VM is shutdown unexpectedly.This bug is still requesting that the framework does a complete shutdown operation on VM termination.  There are still concerns about doing long running operations in VM shutdown hooks. No plans to add this to the framework.

46397	[KeyBindings] Ability to map keypad events	"bug 21035 has been resolved however it is still not possible to map keypad events because the key bindings dialog doesn't distinguish between keypad events and others. In the above mentioned bug I was told to open another request against UI. Why do you want to map against numpad events in particular (as opposed to theirmain keypad equivalents)?  Is this something that might be better accomplishedwith a key filter on the control itself? I am not sure what you mean by ""key filter on the control itself"". But the ability to map to keypad events would allow key binding preferences such as ""brief"" as discussed in bug 32346 (which has 3 votes) and also look at comment 5 on bug 37934. What is this ""brief""? it is a popular set of key bindings:http://www.lugaru.com/man/Brief+Emulation.html I've supplied support in CVS for distinguishing between keys from the main keypad, and keys from the numpad.  I've filtered NumLock, as I can't see why anyonewould want to bind to it, but I can see why someone would be surprised if theywere allowed to bind to it.I have two questions dealing with backwards compatability.  First, if youpressed, ""Ctrl+Numpad_1"" and something was bound to that key, it would open(this is obvious).  However, what would you expect if there wasn't anythingbound to ""Ctrl+Numpad_1"":    1.) Nothing happens.    2.) If something is bound to ""Ctrl+1"", it would open instead.My second question is what would you expect if you pressed ""Ctrl+1"" andsomething wasn't bound to that key:    (A) Nothing happens.    (B) If something is bound to ""Ctrl+Numpad_1"", it would open instead.My initial reaction was 2A, but now I'm not sure whether 1A is the best pair ofanswers.  I think B is never a good idea.  What do you think? I'm going to answer 1A, and keep the main keypad and numpad as distinctentities.  With M5, hopefully anyone who sees differently will object.

Since we use the requires list tomanually define the Dependant-Bundles manifest entry, PDE was not being properlyactivated when PDE UI was.2) PDE Core requires org.eclipse.core.runtime.Platform.parsePlugins, which isnot currently available. Adding to core.internal.plugins.InternalPlatform.3) PDE Core requires the model classes and registry resolution. Re-adding.4) Some classes usually available from org.eclipse.ui now must be imported fromother UI plugins (such as views or workbench).5) Added helper methods to PDECore to provide access to platform configurations(using the IPlatformConfigurationFactory service). 6) References to InternalBootLoader.resolve(URL) were changed to call the samemethod on Platform.7) moved refs to PlatformURLHandler (internal) to the new package(org.eclipse.core.internal.runtime)8) for some reason (couldn't find ref) update.ui.forms needs access toorg.eclipse.swt.internal.SWTEventListener. The converter tool couldn't find, andneither I could (maybe reflection?). But I added the import to Update/UImanifest and it seems happy now. 9) PDE Junit test runner has to dynamically import all packages (see bug 41077comment 10), since it uses reflection to load the test class.10) PDE Junit test runner has to force the activation of the plugin (e.g. usingIPluginDescriptor.getPlugin()) before running, since we don't have auto-activation.

External programs can't be launched either. I thought perhaps I was running out of memory but I don't get any error dialog and the .log file is clean - no messages output anywhere I can tell. All the programs I launched earlier are still running fine, and the console window is popping all over the place with new output from the different processes.One of the 25 is a Workbench, and the other are instances of one smallish Java program I built in the workspace. I still have virtual memory available on the machine (dual Xeon running XP).Is there a limit of 25 launches, or is some undiagnosed error occuring? There is no limit set by Eclipse - are there any errors in the DOS console (if you have one)? I didn't invoke Eclipse from a DOS console. However when I began terminating the launches (selected one in the debug view, pressed the red square button), I noticed that it started launching the ones I had tried to launch 32 minutes ago! In other words, I launched 25 programs, then tried to launch 10 more but nothing happened. When I killed some of the ones that were already running, some of that second group started up (so if I killed 10 of the original, the 10 I tried to launch earlier finally started). It's like they were quietly queued up somewhere, but the queue was not visible anywhere (I checked the progress window but they weren't there either). Wierd. I can reproduce the problem. After 25 launches, launching other programs has no effect. Once I terminate one of the original 25 launches, my ""queued"" launches are launched.Luc, does the same thing happen on Linux?

45951	Multiple ISaveParticipants to plugin	Currently Eclipse allows only a single ISaveParticipant implementation to be registered to a plugin. Not sure the reasoning behind this.   It would be nice if they allow multiple ISaveParticipants to be registered to a single plugin.  For example we want to have an ISaveParticipant that stores the classification of a resource to a file and also another ISaveParticipant that stores the maps and generation list for a resource.  Since we cannot register both we are forced to introduce a single SaveParticipant that we register our own WRDSaveParticipant objects to. Why can't one participant do both pieces of work? It's all the same plugin... This won't be considered without a compelling use case. 	2008-10-05 15:15:52	1223230000.0	resolved fixed	e85ed8c	1223320000.0	java/org/apache/catalina/Globals.java java/org/apache/catalina/authenticator/Constants.java java/org/apache/jasper/Constants.java
45933	Autobuild kicks in and stops	Build: I-20031029Fresh workspace. No classpath containers, no nothing.Import org.eclipse.ui and all its pre-reqs as source.The projects are all imported successfully.  All the classpaths are set correctly.  Then autobuild starts, and abruptly ends.  You will see 1-2 warnings and that is it.Invoke a full build manually, and you will see all warnings, etc. and everything will be fine. Wassim - Did you get anything in your .log ? Nothing in the log.  It is pretty strange.  Sometimes only org.eclipse.core.boot compiles and stops.  Sometimes core.boot and core.runtime.  No other projects compile though until I invoke a full build. The build cycle is controlled by Core's BuildManager.The Java builder cannot abort an entire build cycle. Any builder can cancel the entire build cycle by throwingOperationCanceledException.  Build is also interrupted if another thread triesto modify the workspace concurrently with the build.  I will investigate. It looks like if you wait long enough (several minutes), the build restart.Running under the debugger, just after the build stoped I see 5 Worker threads each sleeping for 1 minute. Problem was as follows:1) Autobuild running in thread A2) Other operation tries to start in thread B3) B interrupts autobuild and waits on lock4) A responds to interruption, gives up the lock, and starts to exit5) B obtains lock, finishes operation, and attempts to start another autobuild6) Since autobuild is still running (step 4), the second request to autobuild isignored7) Autobuild job exit started in step 4 finishes, but too late.So, it's a small timing window where a very fast job can start and finish beforethe autobuild has time to properly finish.

45441	IncompatibleClassChangeError at runtime when compiling with -1.4 option	"So we finally figured what changed between 3.0M3 and 3.0M4: the Java Compiler options changed to having 1.4 compliance as the default for generated class files. (We found this out through the circuitous route of inspecting the class file attributes of an M4 compile vs a working command-line one.The optimisation to swizzle JoinPoint for JoinPointStaticPart fails when ajc is passed the -1.4 option, resulting in an IncompatibleClassChangeError at runtime.Test case about to be checked into ajcTestsFailing.... and then we'll see if we can fix it! Fixed in tree.  Once the cause was isolated, the fix was relatively easyThe required change was to use the setActualReceiverType method on the MessageSend node to inform it of the new receiver type so the correct code would be generated in 1.4 mode.  3 other caches of this same type are also updated to try to insulate us from future trouble. What do you mean by fixed? Does it mean that it will be OK if we tell thecompiler to generate 1.4 class files? I just tried running some very simple code: public class Test {   public Test() {	  this(5);	  System.out.println(""Hello()"");      }      public Test(int x) {	  System.out.println(""Hello("" + x + "")"");   }      public static void main(String[] args ) {	  new Test();   }}public aspect HelloAspect {	before() : call( Test.new(..) ) {		//System.out.println(thisJoinPoint.getSignature());			   System.out.println( ""call-before"");	}   	before() : execution(Test.new(..)) {	   System.out.println( ""execution-before"");	}}And it gives me this: java.lang.IncompatibleClassChangeError	at HelloAspect.ajc$before$HelloAspect$1a3(HelloAspect.java:16)	at Test.main(Test.java)Exception in thread ""main"" What gives? I'm using eclipse 3.0M6, AJDT 1.1.4 and AJDT/UI 0.6.4. J2SE versionis 1.4.2_02. I tried both: generating 1.4 and 1.3 (rebuild after each change),both didn't work. Only by setting the source compability to 1.3, and checkingthe default class compat below that, did it work. Fixed in tree means that this bug has been fixed in the latest version of the compiler in cvs.  This fix will be incorporated in the 1.2 build.  If you want access to this fix you need to either wait for the official 1.2 builds or build the compiler yourself from the sources.As you've noticed, the workaround until then is to use the 1.3 source and class compatibility rules that were the default before 3.0M3.

As well I believe that if the crimson parser happens to be used a FileNotFound exception will occur. Need to investigate.

Eugene, committers should be the ones to set the milestone.We are still in the process of deciding what will be addressed for 3.0.1 and 3.1. This is unlikely to occur for 3.0.1.The best way to ensure that a bug report / enhancement occurs is to provide a patch.  Thanks Darin. This issue probably even more fundamental. Because XML editor is kind of acommon component it probabli make sence to make a good, fast, generic andexpandable XML editor and then use it for specific extentions like Ant editor. The problem with applying generic editors to specific applications would be similar to using a text editor for doing your Java code :-) Unless the generic XML editor is very powerful and would need to allow for major configuration for a specific domian such as Ant...this would be no small task.Currently the Ant editor is Ant specific with Ant specific parsing and error messages. Well formed XML does not make an Ant buildfile. The problem with current Ant editor is that it rely on strict XML parsing andonce XML is broken it does not work at all. You can break XML for a short time(e.g. when inserting new elements) and it should not have impact on completion,validation and outline. I logged bug 70873 for improving code assist etc. By the way, it seems that there will be an XML editor as part of WTE project. Istill wonder if it could be generalized and concrete plugins could providecontext sensitive completion and navigation.

45413	OutOfMemoryError while checking out modules	"I'm loathe to report OutOfMemoryErrors as bug, as they can easily be fixed byincreasing the heap size.  However, using 2.1.2RC1 for Linux/GTK, I got anOutOfMemoryError while checking out eclipse modules.  I was checking them outone by one from the CVS exploring perspective (over ext).After each check out, the workspace would automatically rebuild (which was quitetime consuming).  After a while, one of the rebuilds failed with anOutOfMemoryError.Only 641 errors and even less warnings existed in the workspace.  It seems weirdthat an OutOfMemoryError would occur. The memory consumption has nothing to do with the amount of problems reported. Did you launch Eclipse with memory settings (by default it will depend on the default of the chosen VM). Specify command line arguments ""-vmArgs -Xmx256MB"" to allow Eclipse to use more memory. Ok to close? I guess I'm just being picky.  I suppose my argument is of the form: if Eclipse will quickly need more memory than the default amount (64MB on Sun's 1.4.x JDK), then why doesn't the eclipse executable set it higher?Maybe just a pipe dream, but it would nicer if Eclipse ""just worked"".  :P Apparently there is a technical limitation on eclipse executable, though I agree with you that we shouldn't have to explain this detail over and over again...Moving to platform. *** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 33972 *** "	2008-07-16 17:49:44	1216240000.0	resolved fixed	83fe69a	1220390000.0	java/org/apache/cometd/bayeux/Bayeux.java java/org/apache/cometd/bayeux/Channel.java java/org/apache/cometd/bayeux/Client.java java/org/apache/cometd/bayeux/DataFilter.java java/org/apache/cometd/bayeux/Listener.java java/org/apache/cometd/bayeux/Message.java java/org/apache/cometd/bayeux/SecurityPolicy.java java/org/apache/tomcat/bayeux/BayeuxException.java java/org/apache/tomcat/bayeux/BayeuxRequest.java java/org/apache/tomcat/bayeux/BayeuxServlet.java java/org/apache/tomcat/bayeux/ChannelImpl.java java/org/apache/tomcat/bayeux/ClientImpl.java java/org/apache/tomcat/bayeux/HttpError.java java/org/apache/tomcat/bayeux/MessageImpl.java java/org/apache/tomcat/bayeux/RequestBase.java java/org/apache/tomcat/bayeux/RequestFactory.java java/org/apache/tomcat/bayeux/TomcatBayeux.java java/org/apache/tomcat/bayeux/request/MetaConnectRequest.java java/org/apache/tomcat/bayeux/request/MetaDisconnectRequest.java java/org/apache/tomcat/bayeux/request/MetaHandshakeRequest.java java/org/apache/tomcat/bayeux/request/MetaSubscribeRequest.java java/org/apache/tomcat/bayeux/request/MetaUnsubscribeRequest.java java/org/apache/tomcat/bayeux/request/PublishRequest.java test/org/apache/cometd/bayeux/samples/EchoChatClient.java

When we use the Update Classpath option, the dialog opens and it says one is selected but our plugin does not appear in the list.  If I click finish, the classpath is not updated.  The only workaround is to put a bogus runtime JAR in the plugin.xml and then select the option.  Then we have to remove this JAR once we are finished.

45691	Variable selection UI	"I agree that dropping a bunch of ""Variables..."" buttons doesn't make for a real slick looking dialog, but I don't think it's appropriate to open a dialog with a code assist (Ctrl-Spacebar) style action either. I also don't see how using a code assist style could be used for variables that require user configuration, since AFAIK there is no way to determine if a variable requires configuration or not.We don't use variables in that many places right now. On the regular launch config dialog, they can be used in the Working Directory Path, the VM Arguments, and the Program Arguments. They are also resolved for Main type, but that was put in for use programmatically more so than user configured launches.On the external tools launch dialog, variables are used for arguments (which already has a button), location, working directory and AntClasspathEntry also resolves variable. Using buttons on this dialog would admittedly be a challenge since some fields already have two buttons (""Browse Workspace..."" and ""Browse File System..."").I think both approaches have their benefits and drawbacks, but if using buttons could be made to work it would save a lot time and it would be easy to delete the buttons later if it was decided to go in a different direction. Forget I ever mentioned the words ""code assist."" :-)The UI should be a little icon next to the text field. When you hover the icon, a pop-up appears that says something like ""Variables Available"" or ""Insert Variable"". When you click on the icon, the variable selection dialog appears. Selecting a variable inserts it into the text field. The 'smart fields' (code assist in text widgets in dialogs) has been implemented in the platform (SWT) - but clicking on the lightbulb does nothing for the smart field case. I would suggest not to introduce a different user interaction. The light bulb means code assist is available. Since there is no support for adding alternate icons (that I know of) I would suggest this is not a feature we want to add without platform support - besides it sounds like you are wanting a button with an icon instead of a label - which is problematic from the accessibility point of view. I don't think that would be a blocking accessibility problem since you can just type in variables and I'd expect to be able to tab to the icon. Other options:1. My original suggestion. Put ""Insert Variable..."" in the context menu.2. Create a real button next to the field with an icon on it instead of the icon-only approach that represents code assist. The button would look just like a toolbar button.3. Create text-labelled buttons.I prefer #2 because it would save space. The best example is the external tools main tab, which would have three buttons per text field if we went with #3. This would be so unwieldy, you'd have to put a group around the widgets to be able to tell which buttons go with which text field.I'll throw together a quick mock-up with screenshots so you can see what I mean. Last time I tried this, I was turned down. We wanted buttons in the LCD for ""new"" ""delete"" ""duplicate"", with images only - however it was not allowed. Thus, we do not have a ""duplcicate"" button (since there is not enough space). I'm going ahead with implementation using ""Variables..."" labels on the buttons. The label can always be removed in favor of icons if accessability isn't a problem Created attachment 9116patch to AntMainTabchanged numColumns from 2 to 1, added call to Dialog.applyDialogFont() Created attachment 9154patch to org.eclipse.ui.externaltools released changes in:JavaArgumentsTab, VMArgumentsBlock, WorkingDirectoryBlock, and LauncherMessages.propertiespatches for changes to:AntMainTab, ExternalToolsMainTab, ExternalToolsLaunchConfigurationMessages.propertiesJared, please verify. changing status to resolved/fixed Reopening.

Changes to VMArgumentsBlock, LauncherMessages.properties, WorkingDirectoryBlock, and ExternalToolsMainTab Please verify Kevin. verified We should make a pass over all launch config fields that support variables and make sure they have some UI for adding variables using the variable selection dialog. For fields where a button isn't good, we should add an item to the context menu ""Insert Variable..."" Also, the ""working directory block"", used by Java config tabs, should be reworked. It should be made to look like the working directory editor in external tools. As well, it was suggested that we should display ""dyanmic"" variables and descriptions in the pref page, just so users are aware that they are there (no value would be displayed). There is work that needs doing in Ant land for this as well...bug 25590 *** Bug 56831 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** Our implementation should be similar to what JDT does for text fields that support code assist. They not place a little light-bulb next to text fields, which tell the user that code assist is available. To see this, select a static member and choose Refactor->Move.Please ignore my comment #1; that issue is handled in a separate bug report. Created attachment 9041jdt.debug.ui.20040330.txtThis is a patch from Kevin which implements an alternative UI for the JavaArguments tab. It creates full buttons next to the text fields. This approachdoesn't scale well (we'll end up with a ""Variables..."" button next to everyfield), but I'm attaching it here to fall back on if we don't manage to get theless intrusive UI implemented for 3.0. *** Bug 56060 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** I'm not sure I agree that the code assist style is the way to go here, but my only -real- argument against it right now is that some variables require configuration (resource_loc, resource_path...) that can't be done without the dialog.Darin, do you have an opinion on this? We wouldn't pop up a context menu, we'd still open the dialog. The similarity I'm talking about is just the button presentation. I had a longer message typed up where I explained this, but it looks like I lost it in an edit. A code assist style interation could be a nice UI. I could imagine a UI that has code assist for variable names, and if you select a variable that requires more configuration, a dialog would open to do the configuration.

In both cases this would indicate a platform issue since all build path markers are created with a severity attribute.Moving to platform/core. Is this a concurrency issue ? Markers being removed while some code is running ? From reviewing the code I can't see any obvious concurrency problems that wouldcause null entries in the array or ""lost"" attributes.

45608	Regression - Incorrect Shell highlighted in Windows Taskbar	"When a breakpoint is hit, the correct WorkbenchWindow containing the Debug perspective used to flash/blink in the windows taskbar.  Also, the windows taskbar would slide out if set to ""auto-hide"".In 3.0 M4, the incorrect workbenchWindow is flashed instead.  For me, it is the ""first"" shell, which happens to contain the Java perspective.  If I ALT+TAB to the WorkbenchWindow containing the Debug perspective, windows is not happy, and refuses to hide the Taskbar until I make the other workbenchwindow be the active shell.  Of course I must do this, because the taskbar (Left side of Desktop) is covering most of the Variables View. Bouncing this to Luc since he has a WinXP box in his office (collecting dust). I cannot reproduce the problem, it works fine in the last integration builds(I20031209).Randy: do you still see this problem ? To reproduce the problem you need to use M4.  Did you try with M4? Verfied this works for me in I20031216. We did not change anything here, so I expect this was a transient SWT bug. Reproduced in M8.Steps to reproduce:1) Open two workbench windows, one containing the Debug perspective.2) Launch a target in debug mode with a breakpoint3) Bring the workbench window without debug perspective to foreground4) Switch to your running App, and cause a breakpoint to be hit.The MRU workbench window is flashed in the taskbar instead of the window containing the debug perspective.

45459	JDT compiler more restrictive than javac	"Here is the scenario that is causing problems to PDE when self-hosting against OSGi runtime:1) Take M4 build2) Download OSGi runtime from Equinox home page (build 1010) and unzip on top of the build3) Start another Eclipse driver (not this one) with a clean workspace. Configure it so that PDE->Target Platform points at the M4 OSGi build created in 2).4) Import all the external plug-ins and fragments as binary projects into the workspace.5) Create 'Hello, World' plug-in using PDE 'New Plug-in project' wizard. Keep all the defaults.Notice that the build fails with the following error in XyzPlugin.java:The type org.osgi.framework.Bundle cannot be resolved. It is indirectly referenced from required .class files.	XyzPlugin.javaXyzPlugin does not reference Bundle type directly anywhere. However, it does extend AbstractUIPlugin, which in turn extends Plugin (provided by org.eclipse.runtime.compatibility) and this class has 'Bundle getBundle()' method, as well as Bundle private field.As suggested, I went into the workspace from the OS shell and tried to compile XYZPlugin using javac.exe. I managed to get it to compile without having to put org.eclipse.osgi.framework.core plug-in on the classpath (this is where Bundle type is declared).It seems to me that JDT compiler is too eager when resolving Plugin class. It should not need to resolve Bundle reference since it was never used explicitly in XyzPlugin class itself. We used to be resolving too much, and thus finding inconsistencies which we should have been ignoring. We added more laziness, but apparently we are still unoptimal.Must fix.

44986	Support for Breakpoint groups	"I saw few enh. requests concerning the breakpoints view,and I thing that the best would be to have an arborescent view,permitting to group them logically and enable only some groups.Groups would have to be 3-state for the view to be really efficient,internal selection should be kept when the parent group isenabled/disabled.The view could provide a global toggle action to enable/enableall the breakpoints, without needing to put them under a top level rootnode.By the way, when a breakpoint is disabled (maybe because its parent group is),its font should be grayed (more user friendly).Tell me if you need nore info on that, but it is something I wouldreally be happy with !--Steve *** Bug 1545 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** Marking as 3.0 candidate.

I'll tell you anyway.(Except if someone else wants to work on it)-- Steve *** Bug 52518 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** Note we intend to add a toggle to enable/disable all breakpoints without losing their state (effectivele enables/disables the breakpoint manager). However, we will not have support for breakpoint groups in 3.0.

Changing the groups state to disabled should effectively disable the children, but not change their individual enablement state when the group is enabled again.  To indicate this, maybe tri-state checkboxes could be used, or graying the text as suggested above. Randy, how hot are you really on the notion of automatically created groups versus user created? Do you find yourself wanting to disable all/only the breakpoints in a specific file very often?My intuition says that it would be cleaner and more useful to just provide for user-defined groups. For switching between problems, user-defined groups would provide a two-click (turn one group off and another one on) context switch. Auto-grouping would be more clicks and more work - you have to find and disable/enable every file that's involved in a problem.I just don't see the auto-groups being what you want most of the time. So if I'm looking for a breakpoint in some plug-in X, I may have some breakpoints defined in plug-in Y that I want to disable.  So I want to turn off that group ""Plug-in Y"".  Turning off things at the resource level is not as common, but it does help in managing the number of breakpoints and finding the one you want.With manual groups, could a breakpoint/exception be added to multiple groups or just one?  Could groups be nested?  Group control sounds like a nice feature, but what I suggested isn't mutually exclusive.You could still support implied groups when the explicit group is set to NULL.  For example, when I double-click in the ruler and set a breakpoint, it doesn't belong to any manually defined groups.  So such a breakpoint could be auto-grouped according to Project, then Resource.  At least until the user drags it under another group. first choice: all manual, with drag and drop.autogroup if available, should have option to turn off.reason: the break point view is often very small, 3-6 lines at most, 400 pixwide. Any excessive indent or scrolling is not exactly welcomed, hence my desirefor grouping. I don't remember what the default debug perspective looks like. My view displays ~15 lines and is stacked on Variables View. The grouping and indentation would be flattened whenever possible. So if there was just 1 breakpoint in a resource, it could be:+ My Project  - ThisIsMyType [line: 40] someMethod(int)  - ThisIsAnotherType [line: 60] someMethod(int)So we're talking about a one indentation.  Once you get to 2 breakpoints in a resource, the horizontal space requirements go down, not up:+ My Project  - ThisIsMyType    - someMethod(int) [line: 40]    + anotherMethod [multiple lines]    - thirdMethod      - line 90      - line 92To reduce indentation, the user could configure three boolean preferences:-Group by project-Group by resource/type-Group by methodI'm just throwing out ideas.  Just like the Properties View, there could be a toggle action to show/hide groups. Instead of doing auto-groups, I'm now thinking about new selection actions. Something like:  Select All (we already have this)  Select Same Type  Select Same ResourceThis way, you'd get the ability to perform operations like ""disable all the breakpoints in this file"" or ""delete all my exception breakpoints"" without disrupting your user-defined groups. I think we should consider allowing a breakpoint to be in more than one group. For example, if I have groups set up for different applications or different problem scenarios in the same application, it might be common to have an NPE breakpoint in each group. If I can only enable this in one group, it seems rather limiting. Allowing breakpoints in multiple groups would be a problem. Disabling one group would have the possible side effect of turning off a breakpoint on another group. This creates a situation where the user has to wrestle the UI to get reasonable behavior.In the NPE example, the NPE breakpoint doesn't belong in either group if you want it to be independent. It can also work to your advantage. For example - I create a group for all exception breakpoints, and I also have exception breakpoints in other groups of application specific breakpoints. If I decide to turn off all exception breakpoints, but still want my other application specific breakpoints, it's easy to do. Selection actions might be useful for creating groups, but it's not equivalent to having group support.  With groups, you can disable the group, and still retain the individual enablement states (for example half of the breakpoints within a file are enabled).A regexp feature would be welcome too. Core support for breakpoint groups implemented with UI in place for experimentation.Please verify base support, DW. I'll be filing separate bugs for UI features as we come up with ideas. Verified. hmm... actually now that I'm trying it out, I would have thought it makes moresense to group the breakpoints by launch config.  I.e. ""when I launch this app,turn on the following breakpoints and not all the other ones I happen to haveset"" .. this seems to be in line with the way one would program and not want allbreakpoints constantly being hit when in fact you have moved on and aredebugging a different problem.My debugging and launching efforts often cross the same file (esp. in PlatformUI) so grouping by file or project is not useful. You can group breakpoints manually into launch config groups. Generally, the debugger cannot infer which breakpoints are for which config. Agree, that works.The support could exist however to allow you to (when creating a custom group)associate it with a launch config so that it is turned ""on"" when that launch occurs. I see, I'll enter that as a new feature request. "	2008-05-13 04:42:11	1210670000.0	resolved fixed	3c84dcf	1210710000.0	java/org/apache/jasper/compiler/Validator.java

Once as a result of being on osgi.bundles and again because they are in the platform configuration.  This is either because the name is wrong or because the locations are different (one has the version number and the other does not) and the lookup is identifying them as different.  This is likely since the location is the unique value  in traditional OSGi.  The name is just a string. This was actually a bug in EclipseStarter.  loadBundles which processes osgi.bundles was not testing if the given location contained a bundle or not.  It has been updated to test.

What i find strange is the domain of the url: http://homepage.mac.com is a apple macintosh site! Have you tried navigating the actual update site?In fact, not even http://homepage.mac.com/ridesmet exists, so it looks like the site url is invalid. You may need to get an updated url. You must have a feature installed that has 'updateURL' attribute set to the URL above and Eclipse Update tries to connect to find if there are new versions of the feature in this site.  so how do i change this? i never changed such a thing as a URL in eclipse because in former Eclipse versions, the feature update worked okay. ? The problem is caused the feature provider, they should ensure the update url's stay valid or re-direct things. You can fix it in two ways:1. edit the feature.xml inside eclipse\features\the_feature_you_installed and change the url attribute to a valid value (or simply remove it , if you don't know what the new url is).2. use a policy file to redirect updates to another location. See this doc for some description:http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/platform-update-home/doc/working/update-policy.html I search my features directory for the string ""homepage.mac.com"" and it found the following 3 ""feature.xml"" files:features\org.apache.log4j_1.2.5features\org.apache.oro_2.0.6features\org.jdom_0.0.8So, what shall i do? i didn't install apache as a feature in eclipse. Shall i remove the complete folders? or are they used internally by eclipse? i don't have a apple mac and wonder why a macintosh url is there. I don't want to break my eclipse. None of those features is used by eclipse, they're additions you or someone else installed.To be safe, why not just re-install eclipse cleanly? i'm afraid of reinstalling eclipse because i did this in former versions and other people set, that the whole settings are stored in .metadata folder that i only need to backup and restore after reinstalling eclipse. the result was, that it didn't do this correctly and i lost all my projects and settings. i can't afford to configure all projects and settings in eclipse i have done until now. :-( It looks like you have installed some unknown features and they are giving you trouble. Either remove them (you may also want to remove their associated plugins) or re-install eclipse.I will close this bug as it has nothing to do with the correct functioning of the update manager. The problem are the non-eclipse features you have installed and the workaround is to clean them.

My Eclipse setup is: Window --> Preferences --> installed JREs --> JDK 1.3.1 (tocompile with 1.3.1).I have a debug configuration that has the following setup: In ""Source"" tab: ""Usedefualt source look up path"" deselected (otherwise, JRE System library for 1.3.1would be in) and manually added JRE System library JDK 1.4.2 using ""Advanced -->Add container"" and moved this item to the top of the source list.But when debugging and stepping through SUN code (e.g. class java.lang.Thread),I see the 1.3.1 source and the code pointer moves through non-code parts of thesource, e.g. comments, space lines, ...If I switch the preferences to using 1.4.2 as default JDK, I get the correctcode when debugging, but as said I shall compile using 1.3.1 in order to avoidusing language elements not present in 1.4.2.Juergen Kremp What type of launch configuration is this? (I.e. ""Java Application"", ""Remote Java Application""...?) It is a ""Remote Java Application"" configuration that I use to connect to theremote server where the code is executed (using JDK 1.4.2). Needs investigation. Reproduced.It appears that JRE System library container is never resolved correctly for thesource lookup.It is resolved to the source of the JRE libraries of the VM use to run theprogram (from the launch configuration), or in the case of remote debugging, tothe VM associated to the project. I released a fix.Basically, it now returns the content of the container as locations where tolook for the source, instead of trying to resolve the runtime classpathcorresponding to  container (what fails).The tests pass with the fix.Darin W: I don't know well this code, please check if my changes have no sideeffects. I disagree with the fix. This fix never uses the resolver contributed for the container, if there is one. Fixed in JRERuntimeClasspathEntryResolver.

It's actually both ways. You can select an author in the annotate view and the block is highlighted in the editor or as you browse the file the annotate view's selection will update and follow the selection in the file. So you can put your cursor on a line in the file and find out who did what.Your suggestion is interesting, but again I like to see the list of authors instead of colors that I have to hover over to see the author name. Perhaps I should elaborate a bit.I do not suggest that the current functionality goes away, but is enhanced withadditional information.  If I have understood it correctly I can see what""block"" a given line belong to, but I cannot - as it is in M3 - see directlyfrom the source window which line_s_ belong to a given block as shown in the CVSAnnotation view.  I _must_ click to learn that.  I therefore think there is aneed for additional information.My suggestion of doing color encodings in the left column to show this, is theleast intrusive and still informative way I could figure out.

Its adding the elements 1 by 1 to a new Vector thenreturning that.  While getSourceConnections simply uses vector.clone(),obviously much faster, cleaner, simpler, etc..However the larger issue is that lots of lists are tossed around in the GEFarchitecture, but never are they cloned before hand.  Only time they are clonedis by the receiver of the methods data, when that receiver knows it might modifythe contents.so perhaps GEF should specify that returned lists are not to be modified, thennobody has to wonder if they should return clones such as this one example does. OR they all should return clones.(or unmodifiable collections) You cannot clone a Hashtable and end up with a Vector.I have added to the JavaDoc for getModel***() that the returned List must not be modified. This brings several questions.1.  Why are inputs a hashtable but outputs a vector?2.  Why are they not both List?Even so with hashtable one can use the proper Map interface method of return new Vector(inputs.values());anyway, I know it works as it is, but the point was to clean it up a bit.  Ithink as the rest of the architecture does, would be best to return List insteadof the List implementation, Vector.Finally, if the return list should not be modified, then their is no reason toclone it.  If we clone it then their is no reason it shouldn't be modifiable.  Ifavor returning the list without cloning it. I was young then...I favor cloning much more heavily now :)  As I recall I didlook at the code and understood better what was going on and I had severalassumptions wrong.  I can't recall now what they all were.  I still favorpassing more generic variables though such as List.Probably this one can be closed as a lack of comprehension of the implementation.

43758	[Jobs] Should run progress views and status lines with one update job	"Build 20030925If the Progress view is visible and theres's a lot of background activity (e.g. a long autobuild, or a CVS checkout), the whole Workbench freezes while the Progress view is updating.Closing the Progress view makes the UI more responsive. This is because the progress view updates every 100 ms and there will be a lot of updates if a lot of work is going on. These updates should be slowed down if the system is very busy.John is there a decent way to make this determination? We've had a few reports of responsiveness problems in the latest build, so I'mgoing to do some much need profiling this afternoon to see what I can turn up.I'd like to understand where the time is going before we do further tweaking. I have written a test that runs a seperate job for each file or directory entry in your Eclipse install - it usually hits close to 500 posted jobs at a time.The presence of the ProgressView appears to make no difference (in fact it was faster when the view was open but I think this doesn't really mean anything).Jerome can you give me an idea of the types of things going on in your workbench at a given time? I am not sure that we make that much difference but if there are expensive UI operations going on the updates could be a factor in process switching. I have found a place where I was synching during an update to the viewer in the progress view and I have refactored the synch to finish before the update occurs. This will be in build >20030929 but I am going to leave this PR open as I expect we may find more inprovements. I've done some profiling, and I haven't found anything in particular about theprogress view that is bogging the system down. During a background task thatreported 1,000,000 units of progress, the system was responsive and the progressview updated quickly.One thing to consider: the scheduling delay for the ""updating progress"" job iscurrently 100ms... this is the main thing that makes it responsive right now. I.e., on the job that reported 1,000,000 units of progress, the progress managertried to schedule 1,000,000 UI jobs to update the progress view, but only a verysmall number actually got scheduled (one every 100ms).  This is a good thing,but we could consider upping the 100ms delay to something greater, such as 250msor even 500ms to get even more batching. This is not the cause of the problem, but I thought it worth point out:profiling a job that just reports progress in a tight loop shows the largestchunk of time is spent in JobProgressManager.refresh (I think this has beenrenamed to ProgressManager in HEAD).  Most of the time is spent in the overheadof acquiring the object monitor (about 10% of total thread time).In core, we use the ""copy on write"" pattern for situations like this.  Assumingthat modifying the set of listeners is relatively rare, but traversal is verycommon, you can do the following:- On traversal, obtain a pointer to the array and iterate over that:IJobProgressListener[] temp = this.listeners;for (int i = 0; i < temp; i++)   temp[i].refresh(...)- On modification, synchronize and copy the entire array:synchronized (listeners) {  IJobProgressListener[] temp = this.listeners;  IJobProgressListener[] newList = new IJobProgressListener[temp.length+1];  System.arraycopy(temp, 0, newList, 0, temp.length);  newList[temp.length] = newListener;  this.listeners = newList; //atomic assignment}- the synch block when modifying the set of listeners is just to preventmultiple concurrent changes to the listener list.  It doesn't prevent concurrentreads.This is a fairly advanced optimization so I'm not sure if it's worth it at thispoint, but something to keep in mind. Tod, I have autobuild turned on, and all I do is incremental builds. If an incremental build takes a long time (e.g. change the value of a constant), while the builder compiles all the dependent of the changed file, the progress view updates with each package that is being recompiled. And while it is updating, I cannot even move the workbench windows (note that I have several windows open if it makes any difference). Also this is on Win2000.I'll try today's build and let you know if your change improves things. This was where my idea about being able to determine relative busyness of the job manager came in - jobs with DECORATE priority could have thier service time increased when loads are heavy.I now get the list of updates in the synch block but do the updates outside of it - I would be interested in seeing the difference with todays build. I have just checked in 20030930 and the responsiveness with the ProgressView appears to be fine in your case.I am going to close this PR - please reopen if you find a problem use case. Unfortunately, I can still see the problem in I20030930. I'll reopen the bug as soon as I find steps to reproduce. Jerome, how many workbench windows do you typically have open?  I wonder if itonly really starts to thrash when there are many workbench windows.Tod: is there a separate job to update the status line/progress view of eachwindow?  I wonder if this is the problem: five windows with two jobs per window(one status line and one progress view) is ten asyncExecs for each unit ofprogress.  I can imagine this bringing the UI thread to its knees.  Ideally asingle job could update all status lines... Yes they are currently seperate jobs right now mostly because the progress view gets updated much more frequently. I want to avoid computation inside the job or worse yet in a synched part of the job - melding them together would make this much more prone to freezing. Ok, the status line and progress view can't be updated together then.  How abouta single job for the progress view, and a single job for all status lineupdates? This would be similar to our solution for the animation loop, where youcollapsed one job per window down into a single job for all windows. Thats a good idea. Jerome how many windows do you run in I usually have 3 to 5 windows open. The fix for running the progress view with one updater is in build >20031006 Upgrading to P3 as there is now a problem where the status line is getting updated but the progress view isn't - we need to keep the timing consistent.What might be the best solution is to add the 3 UI based listeners (status, progress and indicator) to a single update job. Status line no longer shows updates. "	2007-10-31 11:58:06	1193850000.0	resolved fixed	61ce1a3	1199220000.0	java/org/apache/jasper/compiler/Node.java

Copied comment from the older bug (think we got the dup backwards):If you read the code here, it looks like:if (fValue == null) {  return ""some string"";}return fValue.toString(); // NPE hereSince the valud of fValue is only set in the constructor, I don't understand how this execution flow is possible. Someone else just reported the same stack trace, though (Bug 43195), so it seems to be happening repeatedly. What am I missing? Just FYI, this happened several times to me as well. This seems to happen when stepping quickly (e.g. pressing F6 repeatidly) Just wanted to add that I'm getting the same behaviour repeatedly.  I doesn'talways happen in the same place, but it always happens during stepping (F5 or F6).My VM: Sun build 1.4.1_01-b01I agree from looking at the code that the stack trace appears to beimpossible... possibly it's a JIT bug?  For safety you could always useString.valueOf(fValue) instead of fValue.toString() (or make fValue field final). It seems I actually have to restart Eclipse once I get into this state. Restarting the debug session does not fix the corrupt variables view. It seemsthe easiest way to reproduce is to hold down F6 to repeatedly step while avariable is selected in the variables view. I have not been able to reproduce this problem yet (I have tried on 1.4.1 and 1.4.2 VMs). It looks like a VM bug.

Here are two features that I would like to see: * If you right-click on a file in the graphical (not textual) view you should   have an option to ""Show only aspects present in this file."" For example,   when I wanted to see which aspects were affecting my file Foo.java I had to   hide/show every aspect on the list to see if there was a change. * There should be a feature to ""recolor"" the currently shown aspects. For   example, if five of the aspects are gray, but they are the only ones shown   it would be better to see a smart recoloring instead of having to do so   manually myself.These limiting factors affect the scalability of the Aspect Visualizer tool: it's less useful the more aspects you have. for consideration as part of the visualizer update... We have implemented 'right click -> only show colours affecting this bar' in the new visualiser.  We have also added randomly generated colours, rather than grey, when the specified fifteen have been used.  This should improve the scalability when a project has many aspects.  These changes will be included in the new AJDT codebase. Implemented 'right click -> only show colours affecting this bar' action on bars in the Visualiser in 1.1.11.  Also added a drop-down menu to the Visualiser Menu with 'Select All' and 'Select None' actions.  Documentation will be updated with this information in 1.1.12.Increased the number of specified colours, then added a facility to randomly generate any further colours required, rather than using grey.

Whether the tooltip wraps depends on which Font is being used, and of course Windows and Linux have different default fonts.  **BUT** I believe what is happening is the tooltip is being pushed off the desktop.

Created attachment 6291Outline missing message cut offI think he's talking about when there is no palette but the palette view isvisible, like when there is no outline but the outline view is visible. Eclipsefills the outline view with gray and displays a message saying ""An outline isnot available.""  I'm guessing the palette view says something similar.	Theoutline will also cut off the text if it gets too small (only in Linux GTK). This, to me, sounds like a JFace problem.  I'm attaching a pic of the outlineview with this message cut off. Eric, when that message is clipped, can you cause it to paint by dragging another window on top of the wokrbenchwindow?It looks like a GTK painting problem to me. No, dragging another window over the clipped area doesn't do anything.  Icouldn't reproduce this in Eclipse 3.0 M3, so I assume it's fixed, but Icouldn't find a bug for it.

43887	[RFP44] 4.2.5 Filter packages form base classloader	"Otherwise known as ""handling the endorsed libs""Currently class load requests are first delegated to the parent class loader of the bundle (typically  the Application ClassLoader or Bootstrap ClassLoader; we will call it the base classloader here). This is standard classloader practice. However, sometimes it may be desireable to “hide” packages provided by the base classloader so that a bundle may instead provide them.For example, you are running the OSGi environment on J2SE. The J2SE installation provides a version of Xerces and the org.w3c.dom and org.xml.sax packages. However, these packages are an older version that the one needed by bundles running in the framework, e.g. the latest version of Xerces. So we want to install a bundle which exports a newer version of these packages. The framework must be configured to “hide” the old version of these packages from all bundles, so that the new versions of the packages can be instead used. OSGi R4 allows for packages from the parent (boot classloader) to be hidden from bundle classloaders.  I'm resolving this as fixed.  Please re-open if there are additional features we should consider.  For example, we had talked about hiding packages from certain bundles but not from others.

43435	CLASSPATH of Project wrong (NoSuchAlgorithmException)	"I had a hard time getting an application running under Eclipse that works okay when running out of Eclipse with a batch file. With the help of somebody in the JDC Forum (that had a similar problem with Eclipse and solved it) I also was able to workaround it. Here's the problem:using JCA by creating a secret key via a Algorithm didn't work (NoSuchAlgorithmException) when the application runs in Eclipse. The post of venkateshmj in http://forum.java.sun.com/thread.jsp?forum=9&thread=430078&start=0&range=30#2024814 described the problem and its solution:""The basic thing is, eclipse will not find the provider jar file which is in '%java_home%\jre\lib\ext'. So if you are using jboss-ide, open the jboss debug and configure the classpath. Disable 'use default class path'. Add sunjce_provider.jar and jce.jar to the 'User classes'. Remove sunjce_provider.jar from the 'Bootstrap Classes', retain jce.jar in 'BootStrap Classes'. ""As I don't use JBoss but a simple Java application, i had the same problem and the same workaround worked for me:In ""Bootstrap classes"" of the application un configuration, I removed the default ""JRE_LIB"" entry and added (in replacement) rt.jar, jsse.jar, jce.jar to the ""Bootstrap classes"". with this change, the NoSuchAlgorithmException vanished and it worked. With this program, and a default classpath (using JRE_LIB or a ""System library""), it works. If I use a ""non-default"" classpath it does not work (i.e. just uncheck the ""use default classpath""). public class ListJCA {	public static void main(String[] args) {		try {			Provider[] aProvider = Security.getProviders();			for (int i = 0; i < aProvider.length; i++) {				Provider provider = aProvider[i];				System.out.println(					""Provider ""						+ (i + 1)						+ "" : ""						+ provider.getName()						+ "" ""						+ provider.getInfo()						+ "" :"");				List keyList = new ArrayList(provider.keySet());				Collections.sort(keyList);				Iterator keyIterator = keyList.iterator();				while (keyIterator.hasNext()) {					String key = (String) keyIterator.next();					System.out.println(key + "": "" + provider.getProperty(key));				}				System.out.println();			}		} catch (Exception e) {			System.out.println(e);		}		try {			KeyGenerator.getInstance(""DES"").generateKey();		} catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException e1) {			// TODO Auto-generated catch block			e1.printStackTrace();		} 			}} It appears that the addition of \ext\sunjce_provider.jar to the bootpath makes things fail.

If you write a plugin and edit the plugin.xml so that it doesn't correspont to the XML schema, you'll get hundreds of compilation errors in your java files. There's a single error message that your schema isn't valid, but normally because of the huge amount of errors, you can't see it.It would be nice if the schema check occurs first and if the schema is invalid, you get an error message and the following compilation step doesn't find place, so that you see that there's a schema error and have to fix it. Compilation errors are reported by the Java builder, while the syntax error in the manifest file is reported by the PDE builder.  The Java builder does not and should not know anything about the plug-in builder or plug-ins in general, as it is supposed to be generic. 	2007-08-26 09:28:12	1188130000.0	resolved fixed	9c37a01	1188310000.0	java/org/apache/catalina/session/StandardManager.java

I'm curious. Do you actually change layouts often? And why? Yes i do a lot.The reason is that often i have parallel group of changes going on at the sametime, so for a fast check of what is the project state respect to my and otherschanges i find the compressed tree look invaluable, as it is when i have toprocess small number of changes.But when i have to commit large number of changes that must be processed ingroups, and a group is spread in many subfolders that share a common parent iswitch to full tree look, select the common parent and commit from there insteadof having to select from compressed tree look each resource i want to commit.It already happened a couple of time that selecting resources from thecompressed tree i missed some, so i prefer working in the second mode that makesmisses virtually impossible.Also when i have to select many resources too often i make the wrong click anddeselect all the previously selected so having to restart again.Well, to conclude, in my minimalistic view i think a single click is better thanmany. Don't you? There is a Layout menu in the sync view now. It could be added to the ctx menu though. I'm pretty satisfied with it now, thanks.I think that now the function is easily reachable, at least for my needs, and,rethinking a bit what i wrote opening the bug, putting it in context menu couldbe an overkill.If you really got spare time i'd like most an ""expand all"" button in the syncview... ;)Regards, Gabriele.

Created attachment 5920Welcome page under Win32 Asking platform if they have change something in this area. The welcome editor hasn't changed recently.If the welcome.xml (in the plugin for the corresponding feature) has format=""wrap"" (which the JDT welcome page does) then the composite in the WelcomeEditor forces itself to relayout.  It uses a vertical GridLayout of two columns.  The children are Labels and StyledTexts.Lynne or Knut, do you know if there have been any recent changes to how StyledText computes its preferred size (in computeSize) when SWT.WRAP is specified? No recent changes that I am aware of.  I will investigate further. We fixed word wrap bugs back in June. See bug 31195 and 38344. Both released June 16. There should be no platform specific differences in wrap behavior.When I first open the JDT welcome page it wraps fine and no text is cut off. When I resize the editor smaller horizontally the text is rewrapped properly. However the individual StyledText widgets don't grow taller so some of the wrapped text is invisible. As the welcome editor is resized, the size of wrapped text widgets needs to be recomputed.  Changed the welcome editor code to set the widthHint when the widget is resized.  The height of the text widget will then be calculated based on the widthHint. Verified fix on Mac, closing. I'm curious as to why this change was needed though.

42643	[Editor Mgmt] Need extension to intercept editor opening	"So far we're committing to addressing the team operations, and issues aroundmaintaining workspace consistency (e.g. if I try to delete the template file fora Tapestry page from the Navigator, Spindle should have the chance to warn methat this may corrupt the page).This issue about editor opening and other editor lifecycle only came up againrecently (this PR notwithstanding) and I'm still working on defining therequirements.  Any input you can give to make the requirements more concretewould be helpful.Here are my current requirements for editor opening.  These are backed up byconcrete scenarios from some of the IBM products (not included here).If you can elaborate on these items based on Spindle scenarios, or if you thinkthere are missing requirements, please comment.Editor lifecycle- pick the most appropriate editor when opening a logical model element  - whether from model-specific view or generic view- pick the most appropriate editor when opening a file  - whether from model-specific view or generic view  - handle case for shared resource (e.g. WSDL file)  - handle case for 1 file : N model elements- consistent and predictable treatment of Open (or double-click) and Open With- consistent and predictable treatment of icons for elements (consistent withdefault editor choice)  - for files, content types are not taken into account for performance reasons- consistent and predictable treatment of both initial case, and case whereeditor is already open- navigation from marker (e.g. in Problems view) to appropriate editor- selecting element within target editor- remembering last choice (for both resources and model elements)- sort order in Open With- treatment of platform default items in Open With > Text Editor, System Editor,In Place Editor, Default Editor  - should only show or enable ones that apply  - Text Editor may not make sense- revealing mapping from logical to physical as needed Here is anothr usecase for interception of editor opening: bug 117746 [EditorMgmt] Editors should be able to treat large files specially (e.g. deny opening huge files) I've released the first cut of the support for custom editor opening strategies to HEAD.  The Open With menu is now populated from an OpenWithInfo created by merging the OpenWithInfo objects obtained from IEditorOpenStrategy objects associated with model providers.  There's a default ResourceOpenWithStrategy associated with the resource model provider, which encapsulates the previous content-type and file association-driven strategy in the IDE. I'm having second thoughts about the current approach, and will rethink this for M5. sorry I haven't been much help. The day job is becoming all consuming and I have not been able to give this or Spindle much thought in the last  6 weeks or so.Geoff No problem Geoff, we have other use cases besides Spindle's that are likely either identical or very similar. The model-provider-driven IEditorOpenStrategy approach did not pan out well, mainly because IEditorOpenStrategy required complete knowledge of all applicable editors, which goes against Eclipse's open-ended philosophy.I'm going to have to back out of this for 3.2.

I'm glad though that you were able to experiment with the idea even if the resulting implementation wasn't the right one.Geoff Created attachment 34453Removed code, captured here for posterity's sake. *** Bug 127437 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** Bug 127437 has an interesting use case.A workaround is to define an external editor launcher, which can then do whatever it wants with the file.In the editor extension, specify launcher= instead of class=, where the referenced class implements IEditorLauncher.  The IEditorLauncher is given the file system path, which can be mapped back to IResource using ResourcesPlugin.getWorkspace().getRoot().findFilesForLocation(IPath).See also the Javadoc for IWorkspaceRoot.getFileForLocation for why findFilesForLocation is preferred.Note that this workaround interacts poorly with the editor navigation history though (Navigate > Back / Forward). > A workaround is to define an external editor launcher, which can then do> whatever it wants with the file.Thanks for a quick reply!I tried this workaround but like you said there's some nasty problems with navigation related features. E.g. in java editor following features do not jump to a correct place if the target editor is not open:- ctrl-t navigation- ctrl-1 quick fix when creating a new method- etc..Is there any workround to enable better navigation? Thanks again! Joni, I didn't think navigation would get messed up -that- bad.Can you clarify with specific steps?  What does your launcher do?  I was assuming you'd just turn around and open the appropriate internal editor (bean editor or Java editor) using one of the IDE.openEditor methods. > Can you clarify with specific steps?  What does your launcher do?  I was> assuming you'd just turn around and open the appropriate internal editor (bean> editor or Java editor) using one of the IDE.openEditor methods.Yes, that's basically what i do:public class WicketEditorLauncher extends TextEditor implements IEditorLauncher {    public void open(IPath file) {        IFile[] files = ResourcesPlugin.getWorkspace().getRoot().findFilesForLocation(file);        String editorId = ""org.eclipse.jdt.ui.CompilationUnitEditor"";        if (isTypicalMarkupContainer(files[0])) {            editorId = WicketEditor.ID;        }                try {            FileEditorInput input = new FileEditorInput(files[0]);            WicketPlugin.getDefault().getActivePage().openEditor(input, editorId);        } catch (PartInitException e) {            throw new RuntimeException(e);        }    }Now, normal java classes are opened correctly with CompilationUnitEditor but navigation is broken unless the file happens to already open in an editor. I'm using eclipse 3.1.1. > navigation is broken unless the file happens to already open in an editor. I'msorry, typo. ""unless the file happens to be open in an editor"" WicketEditorLauncher should not extend TextEditor, but that shouldn't cause the navigation problem. Using a similar launcher that just opens a Java editor, I was unable to reproduce the problems reported in comment 24.The code is:public class Launcher implements IEditorLauncher {	public void open(IPath location) {		IFile file = ResourcesPlugin.getWorkspace().getRoot()				.getFileForLocation(location);		String editorId = ""org.eclipse.jdt.ui.CompilationUnitEditor"";		try {			FileEditorInput input = new FileEditorInput(file);			PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getActiveWorkbenchWindow()					.getActivePage().openEditor(input, editorId);		} catch (PartInitException e) {			throw new RuntimeException(e);		}	}} I still can reproduce the problem using the code you provided. The exact steps are:1. Make wicket editor as a default editor for java files from preferences -> file associations.2. Create new class Foo3. Create new class Bar4. Close the editor for Bar5. Open Foo and add following constructor for it:    public Foo() {        new Bar().test();    }6. Go to the problem marker, press <ctrl>-1 and select 'create method 'test()' for type Bar'7. The method is correctly created but the cursor is not moved over the created method 'foo()'. All works correctly if I repeat the steps when the editor for Bar is open (i.e. if I skip the step 4).This is how I have configured the editor launcher in plugin.xml:  <extension point=""org.eclipse.ui.editors"">  	<editor  	  id=""wicketbench.eclipse.editorLauncher""  	  name=""Wicket Editor Launcher (set as default)""      icon=""icons/javaclass.gif""      launcher=""wicketbench.eclipse.editor.WicketEditorLauncher""      	  extensions=""java"">	</editor>  </extension> Thanks, I'll look into it some more. Some of the scenarios here can be addressed using the IEditorMatchingStrategy support, which is intended to handle the case where one editor handles multiple files.  E.g. - open File A   - get editor E on files A and B- open File B  - activate existing editor E and show info for BIn the the editor extension for E, you can specify matchingStrategy=""SomeClassImplementingIEditorMatchingStrategy"".When opening file B, the editors' matching strategy gets a chance to say ""I can handle that"".  If the editor also implements IShowEditorInput, it can switch tabs, or whatever, to show whatever is relevant for the second file. Thanks Nick,I've been thinking about using the IEditorMatchingStrategy but can't figure out how it could help solve my issue. WicketEditor is a MultiPageEditorPart which embeds CompilationUnitEditor (or whatever Java editor the user prefers, e.g. aspectj editor) + editors for other related resources (html, properties). Since CompilationUnitEditor is not designed to be embeddable, there's a few features which I haven't been able to enable for embedded CompilationUnitEditor. The users of the plugin could live with that if non-wicket related java files could be opened with ""real"" java editor instead of non-feature complete embedded java editor. So, this issue is currently a blocker for me since I haven't been able to find a satisfactory solution without major drawbacks. (In reply to comment #33)You need the MultiEditor which would allow you to embed the CU editor with all of it's features enabled.BTW - working with MultiEditor was the reason I opened this issue in the first place :-) Thanks Geoff,I just examined this but the problem with MultiEditor seems to be that it is not possible to associate MultiEditor with a file extension. Instead, it needs to be opened using a custom action, as done in an attached example. So, I propably won't go further that road since you already went there and turned back :) Hi!Has any progress made related to this issue? The navigation problems got even worse with eclipse 3.2. Now debug view can't locate the current line if the editor has been opened using IEditorLauncher. So, any news on these issues would be greatly welcomed:- improved MultiPageEditor support (make it easier to embed existing editors, like java editor, html editor etc.)- improved mechanism to intercept editor opening (so that navigation etc. works)Thanks! (In reply to comment #36)> Has any progress made related to this issue?There are currently no plans to address this for 3.3. This bug hasn't had any activity in quite some time. Maybe the problem got resolved, was a duplicate of something else, or became less pressing for some reason - or maybe it's still relevant but just hasn't been looked at yet.If you have further information on the current state of the bug, please add it. The information can be, for example, that the problem still occurs, that you still want the feature, that more information is needed, or that the bug is (for whatever reason) no longer relevant. An extension that allowed a plugin to intercept an IEditorInput before the editor opens would be nice.something like:public IEditorInput checkInput(IEditorInput)The use I see would be valuable in the case of a MultiEditor. A plugin could intercept an input, and potenially return a MultiEditorInput to take its place.So the interception would need to occur before the  editor is created.this bug is releated: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=42641Geoff actually I believe the best spot for this kind of interception would be in themethod:private IEditorPart openEditor(final IEditorInput input,final String editorID,final boolean activate,final boolean useEditorID,final IFile file,final boolean forceInternal) throws PartInitException in org.eclipse.ui.internal.WorkbenchPageGeoff MultiEditor was a late addition to 2.0 to address a specific use case in WSAD, and could have been better designed if we had been given more time.It's unfortunate that MultiEditor requires a special kind of editor input, MultiEditorInput, and that the workbench internals know about this relationship.  However, adding an editor input interceptor would just be propagating the problem, in my view.  It would help if you could describe what you're trying to do at a higher level.Note however that the MultiEditor is not a priority for us right now, so there will be a limit to how much we can do here in the short term. Understandable. Here's a more concrete example of what I'd like to be able to do...My plugin provides support for the Tapestry Web Components framework.(http://jakarta.apache.org/tapestry/)Each component (or page) consists of:An xml specAn html template (optional)A java classI'm playing around with MultiEditor, and it would be nice to be able to double click on any of the three above and see all three opened in a MultiEditor.WorkbenchPage.openEditor with all of its permuations takes at least an editor input and an editor id.Would be nice to have the option of examining the input and perhaps substituting a MultiEditorInput before a concrete editor is created.Geoff Do they need to be visible all at the same time.  Seems like screen real-estate would be tight.  If not, a tabbed multi-page editor would be a better choice (and MultiPageEditorPart, which supports this, is less of a hack than MultiEditor). I've gone down the MultiPageEditor route before but I like the first class (even if its incomplete) support for MultiEditor in WorkbenchPage and the EditorManager. In fact I've already altered the sample MultiEditor to be a paged editor (CTabFolder). Just working on getting the key bindings to work right.If its not a priority to improve MultiEditor support in the short term that's fine. I can work around it for now and wait.Geoff So could you enumerate  advantages are there to you in continuing to use MultiEditor vs. MultiPageEditor? I'm implementing a side by side comparison, albeit a quick/rough one. stay tuned I will attach a modified example project containing one each of a TiledEditor, a TabbedMultiEditor and an MPEP implementation.Now, of course I'm just starting to get into MultiEditor but here are a few thingsI've noticed already building the side by side comparison..1) IEditor parts in MultiPageEditor parts are not ""first class"" as far as the WorkbenchPage/EditorManager are concerned. these classes are aware of MultiEditors and so calls like IWorkbenchPage.getActiveEditor() returns the embedded editor part and not  the MultiEditor part (if an embedded was the active, of course). In the MPEP implementation I would get the MPEP back from getActiveEditor() and it would be up to me to determine that its an MPEP, cast, and ask it for the active editor.2) Closing Eclipse almost works right with a MultiEditor. I get the ""Save Resources"" dialog with the MultiEditor *and* any dirty embedded editors in it. In my case that's wrong as the MultiEditor itself has no savable state (I can fix that though). With a MPEP the list would only show the MPEP, saving/not saving embeded editors is not under user control.I expect that many of the ""just works"" features of Eclipse managing Editors would work the same with MultiEditors. If they don't...sounds like a bug!3) Opening multiple embedded editors (genericly) is cleaner (to me) in the MultiEditor than in the MPEP. Currently any action can create a MultiPageEditorInput and call IWorkbenchPage.openEditor(). Doing this in an action with MPEP means I basicly have created my own MultiEditorInput (an input that only my impl of MPEP would understand) and recreate the logic to instantiate the editors that I get for free in MultiEditor. Although, having done all that I get none of the features described in #1 and #2 above.The MPEP implementation was built to duplicate the TabbedMultiEditor. I've noticed some things so far:- how do you create an IEditorPart from an IEditorDescriptor without casting the descriptor to org.eclipse.ui.internal.registry.EditorDescriptor?- As noted above, closing the workbench prompts us only to save the MPEP, there is no choosing from the embedded editors.- can't add the editor label (gradient) shown in the MPEPImpl as CTabItem createItem(Control control) in MPEP is private. Created attachment 6102modfied MEP example containing TiledEditor, TabbedMultiEditor, and an MPEP implementation Geoff, is this still an issue for Spindle?I'm looking at the general area of editor opening as part of our work on supportfor logical models.I'm not so much interested in the use of MultiEditor at the moment, but ratherthe mapping from logical elements (like a Tapestry page) to physical files, andhow to provide consistent treatment for editor opening, whether from the logicalelement or the physical files.Maybe you could describe at a high level how this works currently in Spindle,and what issues you have in this area, if any.For more details, seehttp://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/platform-vcm-home/docs/online/team3.2/model-integration-proposals.htmlalthough note that this describes the general problem and other specific issues,not so much about editor opening.

Themodel also keeps references to any other resources (usually html template files)that would make up a Tapestry page.> > Maybe you could describe at a high level how this works currently in Spindle,> and what issues you have in this area, if any.Right now, there are two instances in Spindle where an editor needs to be opened:1. User selects the resource and editor opening works as per all other editors(double clicking on Markers also falls into this category of course).2. User selects an interesting bit of stuff in an already open editor andinvokes an ""Open Declaration"" action. In this case my model is used locate themodel object in the source and to locate the resource that the model is builtfrom so we can open the appropriate editor and scroll.(one thing that is a pain BTW in case 2 occurs when the Tapestry spec is shippedin a jar.

Yes.. the issue is with keyboard scrolling.. arrow keys. So , if this is already in Eclipse, any idea if WSSD V5.1.1 or greater would now support this?

42444	Error building feature; Cannot find plug-in versions	"I have a situation where I am utilizing a third-party plugin (specifically, a WSAD plugin) which I'll call plugin ""A"". I wrote a plugin called ""B"" which uses one of the extensions from ""A"". Plugin ""A"" requires [""org.eclipse.ui"" version=""2.1.0"" match=""equivalent""]. However, I have eclipse 2.1.1 installed in which ""org.eclipse.ui"" is at version ""2.1.1"" and version ""2.1.0"" does not exist. Plugin ""A"" works correctly in my eclipse environment and even my plugin ""B"" works using its extension when running the Runtime Environment. The problem is when I try to build the feature. It spits up a message saying ""Cannot find plug-in: org.eclipse.ui_2.1.0"". Shouldn't this be able to find ""org.eclipse.ui_2.1.1"" since match=""equivalent"" was defined? I've done some more testing and can reproduce the problem with one plugin...(I'm assuming Eclipse 2.1.1)1. Create a new plugin with the ""Default Plug-In Structure""2. Modify the ""org.eclipse.ui"" dependency ""Import Details""3. Change ""Version to match"" to...""2.1.0""4. Change ""Match rule"" to ""Compatible""5. Create a feature project that includes the newly created plugin.6. Try to export/build the feature.You will then notice the error. Is this expected behavior? This behavior is expected.The matching criterias are runtime artefacts allowing flexibility and control on the requirements. If pde buid was applying the same kind of behavior, there would be uncertainties against what a plugin is being compiled.The only work around is to build a target platform (and refers it from the pde preferences) containing all the versions that you need that will match the requirements you have in your plugins. Here is a concrete example where supporting matching rule can be problematic.I'm writing plugin P which specifies ""import org.eclipse.ui 2.1.0 compatible""In my development environment I have org.eclipse.ui 2.2.0 available.In the code of P, I make use of a new API available in 2.2. Everything compile and run fine.Now when I ship my plugin P, nothing prevent it to be run on a 2.1.0 version (according to the matching rules) and so the customer of P will have errors (undefined method or classes) because P makes use of API not available in 2.1.I sounds like if the only case where the matching could used in a safe way is where ""equivalent"" is specified, since service releases are only bug fixes. *** Bug 44674 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** I just want to give my two cents on this. I hit this problem because the pluginI am working on imports another plugin from WSAD. This import has an import toorg.apache.xerces 4.0.5 (compatible).Even though everything is fine for runtime, I am unable to create the build.xmlfile to create my plugin. I found that by removing the src element from thebuild.properties I can at least have the build.xml file generated.The comment about the versions at runtime is true but it is also true in anyother situation. The framework should not preclude the developer from trying towrite code. If you feel strong about it, maybe a warning can be produced in thecase of compatible but not for equivalent. I would have to question why this is expected behavior. I too am extending WSAD plugins. IBM ships WSAD 5.1 with several plugins that have an import to ""org.eclipse.*"" of a version lower than what is installed. For example, an IBM plugin imports org.eclipse.ui_2.1.0 and WSAD is shiped with org.eclipse.ui_2.1.1. My plugin doesn't even use any of the ""org.eclipse.ui"" APIs and doesn't import it, however, I can't build my plugin because of the dependency of a third party plugin? I would agree with Francisco that if ""compatible"" is set, a warning should be displayed. Isn't that the purpose of ""compatible""?, it kind of implies ""risk""?And I guess I kind of agree with the concrete example in that it could be problematic if I were using a higher version API. However, by using this ""compatible/equivalent"" technique, I, the developer, must be aware of the plugin's compatibility and assume responsibility.Unfortunately, IBM didn't provide the plugin versions WSAD was built against. In cases like this where there are good arguments on both sides of a design point, it usually makes sense to allow both to occur.   Can an option be added to allow plugin dependencies at build time to be treated the same as they are at runtime?   The default could remain as it is today, with strict adherence to version numbers, but giving the user the choice would solve this problem I believe.Just to add my 2 cents to the mix, I think that as Eclipse evolves as platform for integration of components potentially built/tested by completely different teams/companies, this situation will come up more and more.   The fact that some component of WSAD was built with version 4.0.7 of a dependency, and another was built with 4.0.13 of that same dependency should not force us to ship both versions just so that extension writers can use the PDE.   Thanks.Jeff Turnham (WSAD Release Team) Since there are good arguments on both sides, a flag allowing flexibility will be added in 3.0. Any chance of fixing this on 2.1.1 stream? It is really frustrating that Icannot get Eclipse to build my plugin for me. From the current Eclipse plan andWSAD's plan, having to wait for the new version seems to be a long wait. The final 2.1.2 build has already happened.This will be fixed for Eclipse 3.0. *** Bug 43072 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** To add the duplicate bug thought to this report (see https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=43072).There is a way to zap Eclipse to allow what you want.  See the duplicate report for the code zap I made and a 2.1.1 level JAR.Just a thought - if you are willing to make this change to your build system. Thanks Pat for the jar file. I just wish they would fix this on 2.1.2 but it hasalready been closed. I'm testing the jar file pdebuild.jar in WSAD5.1 (which, as far as I know is based in Eclipse 2.1.1) and when I try to build my feature it gets hours with the dialog box ""Generating build scripts"" but nothing happens. The only way I have to continue working with WSAD is to kill javaw proccess.The org.eclipse.pde.build plugin has 2.1.0 version but other eclipse plugins in WSAD5.1 are 2.1.1. As the creator of the jar.... I'll take a look at this as soon as I can get some cycles....I'll use my own install of WSAD 5.1 and my own feature/plugin set. I am unable to replicate the hang on my machine using either a local copy of the zap-fixed jar or a copy based on the download from the https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=43072 attachement(after renaming the file from pdebuild.jar.zip to pdebuild.jar).Note that I mislabeled the attachment as 2.1.1, it is based on the plugin version 2.1.0 (not all plug-ins were 'touched' between 2.1.0 and 2.1.1).marroysc@isban.es - can you provide more detail on your feature.xml content which may trigger the hang and/or describe it such that I can try again?Pat Mc. It seems that there is an time issue about the fix. The fix works but with WSAD it spends up to 5 hours building the feature.I'm going to make more testing and try to optimize my WSAD and let you know. I`ve being generating different features with plugins depending on IBM plugins (depending on one IBM plugin) and it works. It spends up to 20 minutes.But we have a feature which contains a plugin which depends on three IBM plugins: com.ibm.etools.j2ee, com.ibm.etools.webedit.core and com.ibm.etools.webedit.editor.This feature is the one which spends 4 hours in building itself. *** Bug 48317 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** My defect was marked as duplicate of this one. I'm aware that 2.1.2 build has already happened but is there any way to resolve this bug in a fix pack to 2.1.2? The bug blocks us from providing a complete solution to our customers.From description to 48317:""We are developing an IBM product that is targeted against Eclipse 2.1.2. Part of this product will require that the end-user will have the ability to deploy a feature. Therefore this is currently a blocking issue for us. We'd like to have this addressed in a fix pack against Eclipse 2.1 if at all possible.If there is a shortage of resources to work on this problem I could attempt to identify the problem myself and provide fix details to be included in the fix pack."" Given that we are seeing a 2.1.3 maintenance build of Eclipse start, can we get this plug-in/defect fixed now (we see that many do not want to wait till V3).Even if it is my silly zap, anything that works will get lots of broken scenarios fixed.  I'm fairly sure many are broken that don't even know how to find the patch provided in the other defect, and this frustrates them quite a bit. Investigate for 2.1.3.Recommendation for 2.1.3 is to:1). relax the strict version checking when constructing the build.xml2). make this a preferenceThis also needs to make it into the 3.0 stream.  Two possible fixes:- first: resolve the registry and use the PluginPrerequisiteModel.getResolvedVersion() method which indicates the way matching rule has been resolved. Doing that will prevent the building of the multiple version of the same plugin (not library plugins). Although in matter of number of line this change is small, the semantics impact are wide.-second: change the behavior of AbstractBuildScriptGenerator.getPlugin(String, String) to take into account the matching rule. The matching needs to be done according to the state of the art, which means that the correct plugin need to be searched for. This changes require more code changes (more new lines are being added) but is safer than the first one.In either case a preference will be introduced to enable or disable the perfect matching. Created attachment 7514Patch implementing solution 2 It seems to me that, we do not want to be changing the semantics (or even the timing behavior) of anything in a patch release. I would vote for the second change on that basis. Fixed. Released to 2.1.3 build stream. Will port fix to 3.0 stream. I have verified that the following scenerio does not work in 2.1.2 but does workin the latest 2.1.3 candidate build.

The UI wasn't usable but the progress indicator was still being animated. Modified code in WorkerPool.jobQueued around the ""if"" stmt. Dirk, what VM were you using when you obtained that stack trace?  We are notable to get a stack trace with J9SC VM (it doesn't respond to SIGQUIT), so I'mguessing this is with a plain IBM VM?  I've tried repeating the test in a loopfor several hours with a plain IBM VM, and I haven't been able to reproduce thedeadlock. I can only get the deadlock with J9SC. John, I use the IBM VM  J2RE 1.3.1 IBM build cxia32131-20030711a since, as you mentioned, J9 doesn't respond to SIGQUIT. That's the exact VM I was testing with on Friday. I ran the test in a loop forfive hours and it did not deadlock.  It is possible that we are facing adifferent deadlock from the one in Dirk's stack trace.  Mcq will ask the VM teamabout getting J9SC to respond to SIGQUIT... without that it is very difficult todebug. Finally, I was able to get a stack trace.  You can force a GPF on J9SC usingSIGSEGV.  Attaching stack trace. I will run again to see if it is the same. Created attachment 6066Stack dump Created attachment 6067Another dump It looks like the bug is in GTK native code.  Moving to SWT.Note: the stack traces look like GPFs, but this is actually a deadlock.  Theonly way to get a stack dump on J9SC was to force a GPF using kill -s SIGSEGV.Contact me for more detailed steps to reproduce Looking at the stack trace I would say that the app is passing a invalid stringinto the CLabel which is been used later on to compute the size of the Widgetand failing when attempting to convert the string from UCS2 to UTF-8. But sincethe hypotheses of a invalid string is very unlikely and you guys are saying thatthe problem is actually a  dead lock I think SWT is showing in the stacktrace bychance.John, could you please come over my office and help me reproduce the problem ?So I determine if this is a SWT problem or not. Back to square one.  Felipe believes it is impossible for this particular codeto deadlock.  There are loops in the code, but given that the CPU is at zeropercent, and the SWT code has no waits or sleeps, I think this is a red herring. The VM must be giving us a bogus stack trace... It looks like this is an SWT bug after all.  An SWT JNI call is attempting tomake a change outside of a critical region that it is not allowed to make.

Actually - it isonly java files that don't get decorated, other things like gifs/html/etc do getdecorated.  Also, for directories that are not packages, the package explorerdoes do the right thing and updates the decorators. IMO the problem is that you only decorate resources (e.g files and folders) but packages aren't folders and *.java files aren't object of type IFile. *.java files are represented via the type ICompilationUnit and packages are represented via the type IPackageFragement. If you only want to deal with files you can use ""adaptable"" to convert Java specific types into resources.Please reopen if this doesn't help.

41166	Runtime Arguments improperly passed	"When running a JAVA configuration, if you specify a ""Program Argument"" within quotations, the quotations can be dropped when the arguments are passed to the JRE.  For instance- if you specify an argument ""*"", the main() loop of the target class should receive the a String with the a single asterix as its only character.  Instead, the asterix is interpretted as a UNIX *, and the args[] array will contain every single filename within the home directory.  Conversly, this behavior probably should exist if you simply specified an asterix as a program argument (without the quotes). Launch issue Jared, please investigate. Cannot reproduce. If you create a ""Java Application"" launch config and add ""*"" to the Program Arguments, the main() method is passed the single character '*'. Perhaps I didn't describe properly, but the action Jared describes exactly reproduces the bug.  The issue is that if you intend a ""*"" to be passed to the JVM, instead a '*' will be passed which in turn acts as a UNIX '*'.  It seems like the behavior is that entering ""*"" on the Program Argument text box should cause ""*"" to be passed, not '*'.  Is the intention that \""*\"" needs to be entered into the command line in order to pass ""*"" to the JVM?  This seems non-intuitive. Ah, I see. Yes, I believe it is. This shouldn't be non-intuitive. You have to do the same thing on the commandline. Quotes demark the beginning and end of a single argument. You need to escape quotes to pass in the actual "" character. Here's why it isn't intuitive (nor sensical)-  Supposing you provide a list of arguments to the JVM on the command line; you have every expectation that quoting and escaping work in the conventional sense- bounding a string, or inserting a control characater.  What I (which I don't think is abnormal :) expect will happen with the arguments that I provide in the Eclipse ""Program Arguments"" text field is that they are what WOULD appear on the command-line had I run them that way myself.  Otherwise you get into binds like what if you want a '\' to be passed to the JVM?  from the command line you would pass '\\' and then from eclipse you would pass what?  An escaped-escaped-escape character?  That's not the most practical example, but it should generally illustrate the serious problem with eclipse parsing the tokens that are going to be parsed again by the JVM.brad How would you distinguish between the single argument ""foo bar"" and the two arguments ""foo"" and ""bar""?

41666	eclipse hangs during startup refresh of workspace	I noticed recently that eclipse seems to hang during startup. My CPU meter seemsto be running at hundred percent, but nothing is happening.I noticed that this seems to be happening only when I create certain class filesin my project output path (using the jdk version as used by the eclipseworkbench), outside of eclipse and then try to refresh my workspace - by eitherrestarting eclipse, or right clicking on my project root directory and hittingrefresh.The result is that I get the Progress Information dialog which is stuck, withnothing happening.This is really counter productive, it would be nice if there is a way to prevent  this from happening. Move to Plaform/Core. Can you please do the following:1) Run eclipse using java.exe so that you get a console window.  For example:eclipse -vm d:\jre\bin\java.exe2) When it is frozen, hit Ctrl+Break to get a stack dump of the currentlyrunning threads.3) Attach the stack trace as a file to this bug report (don't paste into textbox please).Also, what build of Eclipse are you using (This info is available in Help->About.

Does you application need to pre-req the debugger? Do not intend to do this for 3.0. We're refactoring the classpath dialog currently. It will be more like the source lookup tab with general add/remove/edit functions. The project selection dialog will likely change. See bug 34095. Valentina, do you need this one?

41074	[RFP44] 4.1.7 Transactions spanning multiple life cycle operations	"There are two main issues here; 1) OSGi currently only supports the install/uninstall/update of one bundle at a time.  There is no inherent ability to do ""what if"" queries to better understand the resolution effects of various changes and there is also no way of guaranteeing the atomicity of modifying a group of bundles as a unit (e.g., what happens when you fail halfway through installing a product consistening of 50 bundles?).2) since all management operations are individual, there is no obvious way of batching BundleEvents.  Currently a BundleEvent is generated for each and every individual change to a bundle (install, start, ...).  This is fine if you only ever have a few bundles.  Eclipse products can have 1000s of plugins/bundles so you can imagine the flurry of events when installing a new function set (for example).  Further, to maintain the extension registry structure (an Eclipse thing) we catch these BundleEvents, update the extensions registry and broadcast more events to registry listeners.   These bundles in turn do potentially costly (high overhead) updates to their internal sturctures (e.g., in the UI they create and destroy views, menu entries, ...).  When a whole product is (un)installed some 500 bundles may be at play.  Having the UI update its internal structures 500 times would be slow and cause visible flicker etc.  Instead, we are hoping for a commit() like action at the framework level that will commit a number of changes to the bundle structure.  In turn, the framework would generate one composite BundleEvent (or some such).In the current prototype there are two different though similar approaches described, the PlatformAdmin service and the Resolver service.  Both allow for the formation of alternative states of the runtime (i.e., set of installed bundles, resolution state, ...) and the committing of an alternative state to become the current/real state.  The main differences revolve around API style and the number of possible alternative states.  The PlatformAdmin service allows for one ""future"" state while the Resolver services allows for any number of alternatives (some of which may never be committed).Under the covers there is some amount of packageadmin-like work to be done on commit.  It is unclear if commit() should be eager or lazy in terms of resolution.  [personal opinion: the Resolver (and perhaps PlatformAdmin) allow for detailed setup/investigation of an alternative state before committing.  As such, there does not appear to be any value in delaying the re-resolution past the commit point].Note: the Resolver is a very preliminary specification of the idea and there is no implementation. I think this feature is needed for M4.  Is there anyway we can mark the feature requests to indicate which milestone they are needed by?  Maybe by using the priority field.  P1 would mark the feature is needed for the next milestone (M3), P2 the next after that (M5) and so on. Good point.  Added milestones to the Equinox product.  Tag bugs as appropriate. Need to capture that in a RFC. Jeff to write RFC see also bug 43913 *** Bug 43913 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** What is the status on the RFC? RFC written.

41057	Option to export and import break points at the Breakpoints view	"Please add an option to export and import break points from the break points view. So, it will be possible to share the same advanced breakpoint settings (i.e hit count, enable condition and probably other settings) between developers. Time permitting, for 3.0. We can likely do this in the debug platform by allowing debug models to contribute a breakpoint factory to create mementos for breakpoints and create breakpoints from mementos. This would be, of course, optional, by debug model. Is there are any new on this feature? Darin, maybe you can suggest some approach for easy import/export, so it willhelp somebody else to put it together at least for JDT platform. Sorry, we may not have the resources to do this in the 3.0 timeframe. I think it should be able to be debug model indpendent, since currently breakpoints are persisted using marker support in the platform. We'd just need a way to persist the marker info such that they could be recreated. Can you point out on more details? How external plugin can retrieve breakpointmarkers? Any other pointers to API? Thank you. You can get the breakpoint markers from the breakpointsIBreakpointManager.getBreakpoints()IBreakpoint.getMarker()However, the problem area will be in re-creating the breakpoints. We have code to do this in the breakpoint manager, but it isn't API. I.e. see BreakpointManager.createBreakpoint(IMarker) (private method). Any chance to get this feature implemented/resolved in 3.1 release? Thank you. DJ, is there a public way to persist/recreate a marker in an XML file?  No, there isn't any way to import/export markers yet. Bug 52614 makes thisrequest... Marking as later, depeding on the platform feature to export breakpoints. Darin, wouldn't it be simplier to implement this feature without dependency onproject markers? I actually only interested to export/import conditional breakpoints, so I canshare them between workspaces, so something simple for that would be very, veryhandy. E.g. select group in a breakpoint view and export it to some file, thenimport it maybe even without sticking to the project. This way I should be ableto export even breakpoints assigned to system classes like java.lang.String Sorry to buther you again, but it is almost 1.5 years since I filled thisrequest. Just can't believe there is nothing can't be done about it. Right now Ihave to use more heaviweight things like AspectJ and bugdel fromhttp://www.csg.is.titech.ac.jp/~usui/bugdel/demo/demo5/index.html but reallyprefer to stay with a standard and simple debugger and be able to share thesesettings across the team (which is as far as I know one of the high prioritythemes for Eclipse foundation). New debug groups makes this feature even moreattractive. Anyway, is there are any workaround possible for this? E.g. some quick and dirtyplugin for jdt only that will allow to export and import selected break pointdefinitions to/from external file. The ""quick & dirty"" way would be to find where the marker is persited, and copy that to the appropriate file. (But, I don't know where that is). The file is at<workspace>\.metadata\.plugins\org.eclipse.core.resources\.projects\<projectname>\.markers and it is a binary. I wonder is there is an API or something thatI can use to nicely import/export just selected breakpoint? I really miss thisfeature and woud like to work on it. There is no complete API for this. You'd need to persit the info to re-create an equivalent marker (its attributes, type, resource, etc). Then you'd need to recreate a breakpoint object from the marker (but there is not public API for this). Looking at the problem in more detail, here is the approach I think we should use:* The operation should be integrated with the Import/Export function in the workbench (via the importWizards/exportWizards extension points)* Ideally the ""export"" page would allow you to select the breakpoints to export, and would be seeded with the current selection in the breakpoints view. The ""selection"" viewer on the page would (ideally) mimic the breakpoints view current groupings, and provide checkbox selection for choosing breakpoints to export. However, the checkboxes in the export page represent selection (not enablement).* To persist/restore breakpoints, we should use the IPersistableElement/IElementFactory interface. Currently, we provide element menentos for breakpoints (to restore breakpoints working sets), but the mementos only work if the same marker exists in the workspace. We'd need to improve the mementos to actually persist/restore markers as required. IResources also provide mementos that could be leveraged. Mementos can be saved in XML files via XMLMemento.* The import operation should provide the option to replace all breakpoints or merge (handing duplicates - which would be done by the memento restoration).* We would provide API on the breakpoint manager to create a new breakpoint of a given type (id), which could then be called with #setMarker(...) to restore it. Darin, I believe that from user experience it will be more natural to findexport/import breakpoints actions in ""Breakpoint View"". In general, Wizard is sounds good, even so it seems somehow overcomplicated, butif it will allow to simply click on ""Finish"" after selecting file name forexport and still will export selected breakpoints it will be fine.Also, I'd suggest to have a simple choise on import about what do do withduplicates: skip all, replace all, etc.   By the way, there is another interesting and more powerful approach onimport/export. If breakpoints were stored in some xml or properties file within.settings directory of project (e.g. have some preference if breakpoint ispublic or local/temporary), then you can commit them into version control, soeverybody can see them automatically. Deferred again due to time/resource contraints for 3.1.  This is should be the one of most long living enhancement requests already... :-( *** Bug 93439 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** Features to consider* Hook into global import/export wizard* Also have import/export actions in the Breakpoints view context menu* Will not export grouping information (i.e. show as >), since this is view settings (presentation), not raw breakpoint information* Import will attempt to create the breakpoints, merging with existing breakpoints in the workspaceConsidering for 3.2 Suggested approach:Export:* create XML file representing breakpoints  - entry for each breakpoint consists of     - associated resource XML memento     - marker attributes     - marker typeImport* parse XML file, creating markers    - find assoicated resource (Error if does not exist)    - look for potential duplicate marker based on marker attributes       - don't create if already exists    - create associated marker type (Error if does not exist)    - set attributes on marker    - create breakpoint for the marker Darin, that is a great news! thanks for considering this for 3.2I'd like to suggest one thing just in case. Import wizard should allow to putnewly imported breakpoints into a new or existing group. So, as export wizardshould allow to select breakpoints for exporting (can use the same viewer modelto represent groups, etc). Yes, we would like to display breakpoints by groups (similar to breakpoints view), so you can quickly select related breakpoint for export. However, we'll need to experiment, as generally views within a wizard do not have menus/toolbar buttons to alter their format, as they do in the workbench.Importing into a group is a good suggestion. (In reply to comment #25)> Yes, we would like to display breakpoints by groups (similar to breakpoints > view), so you can quickly select related breakpoint for export. However, we'll > need to experiment, as generally views within a wizard do not have > menus/toolbar buttons to alter their format, as they do in the workbench.Darin, I'd suggest to use current model settings as configured in breakpointview, so it will be no confusion with resorter/rearranged breakpoints withinwizard panels. I'm currently suffering from similar issue in Project->Clean dialog, which isusing different settings to show the same projects as shown in Package Explorerview.

When the current command is not executable, the cursor remains the same (the default cursor) thus not providing the correct feedback to the user.Also... when you first select the resize handle, the tracker is in the initialstate (command = null) and at this point the default cursor should be returned instead of the disabled cursor which is the default behavior inherited from AbstractTool (see AbstractTool.calculateCursor().

40860	[EditorMgmt] Eclipse crashes when maximizing java editor when trying to load file	Eclipse crashes when trying to maximize a Java editor.  At the time, the editorwas open on a file that had not yet loaded.  There was significant backgroundload on Eclipse.  I haven't been able to reproduce this with some quick tests,but it's hard to generate the same level of load.STEPS:-----1.) Open a Java file in a Java editor.2.) Move that Java file from one project to another -- preferrably breaking asmany things as possible (e.g., 500+ compile-time errors).3.) A stub opens in the editor view for the newly-moved file.4.) Immediately double-click on the title bar for the moved file to cause it tomaximize.OBSERVED RESULTS:----------------The window maximizes, but is empty.  It appears as though the contents are stillbeing loaded by Eclipse.  The virtual machine then crashes with a small dialogbox.  Unfortunately, I wasn't running from a terminal, so I have no additionaloutput. What was in the .log file? Nothing was in the log file, unfortunately.

37509	Open Declaration opens class declaration for local variables	"When the cursor is positioned on a local variable representing an object, and ""Open Declaration"" is selected, e.g. from the pop-up menu, Eclipse opens the file where the variable's class is declared. Instead, Eclipse should just jump to the position of the local variable's declaration.When the local variable has a primitive type, nothing whatsoever happens. This is the intended behavior. Currently, we do not have an element representation for local variables (which is what we answer back from codeselect). A text range would be more generic, but less informative for clients (like search references to selection). Forgot to mention that we plan to address this issue for 3.0. *** Bug 37511 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** Similarly.

You're not seeing the Ctrl+C keypresses in the plug-in scenario because they're being eaten by Eclipse as (presumably) copy actions.  If you want your app to run as an Eclipse plugin and be notified of Copy keystrokes then you need to register actions with the workbench, I think based upon the action (ie.- ""copy"" as opposed to hardcoding to Ctrl+C) .  I'm not very familiar with the mechanism for doing this since it resides above swt, but there should be numerous examples of other plugins doing it.

34956	Provide build.xml target to export binary plugin.	"It's been noted that most Eclipse teams still maintain exportplugin.xmlbuild files for building their plugins locally instead of using PDE's generatedbuild.xml file.The only real problem that the build.xml file has is that it dumps the outputinto the input directory. The nice thing about the exportplugin.xml files isthat they build the plugins and output the binary plug-in in a plugin-exportdirectory that is at the same level as the workspace, not inside it.I would gladly change to using PDEs build.xml files if there was a way to getthe same behavior. Either by default or by passing in a property to specifywhere the binary plug-in should be output. PDE now has 'Export' wizard for building plug-ins into the specified target zip file. It leaves no files behind in the workspace. Does this wizard allow me to export all of my source plug-ins to binaryplug-ins located outside the workspace? Can I do it in a close approximationof one click? Using ant, we currently have a single ""master script"" that callsall of our exportplugin scripts. If we switch to using the build.xml files,we'll still want to maintain the master script that calls all scripts toexport all of our source plug-ins at once. Incidentally, does anyone ever want the build.xml files to dump the outputinto their source project? For us, this only clutters our source project withfiles that we don't want to release to CVS and doesn't make a binary projectthat you'd actually want to deploy (it still contains all the source in folders). Give wizard a test ride - it shows you a list of plug-ins you can check to export, so it is close to one click (not exactly one, though). We don't dump into the source project - we build and export into the zip file outside the workspace. Resolving - already addressed using Export wizard. The export wizard doesn't solve our problem. What we want is a way to use PDEto build export a ""binary plugin"" from the source plugins that we develop.The goal here is to allow us to stop using our custom exportplugin.xml filesand use PDE instead. I think my original request may have been a little lessthan what we want. Allowing a property to be passed in to override the outputdirectory would still be good, but I think we really need a new ""exportbinary"" target that does what the exportplugin.xml scripts do now. I'veupdated the bug summary to reflect this. If you prefer, I can open a new bugreport instead.Specifically, build the plugin jars and copy the jars and the appropriatedirectories as specified in the build.properties file (like icons) to createa binary plugin. That's a nice 2.2 line item for us :-). Is this bug still relevant?  The export wizard has been incrementally improving over the past 4 years.  closing as INVALID, please REOPEN if still valid.

40306	[misc] Javadoc view: Should always update to latest element	M2 testingIf the cursor is placed at an element that does not contain documentation, theview does not update and the documentation of the previous element is kept.I think this is very confusing: If you don't follow the updating of the view,you don't realize that the doc does not correspond to the current element. You startreading and find out that this makes no sense. See also bug 40301, that thecurrent element should be rendered prominently on the first line.An Idea might to be a 'lock' button on the view tool bar: If it is pressed, theview does then not follow the selection. Lock button a good idea but I'd better like a view menu which allows to set:[] Keep old element if new input is invalidWould this solve your problem? *** Bug 40293 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** yes, that would be good.  *** Bug 44194 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** *** Bug 46944 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** *** Bug 53030 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** *** Bug 112538 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** Fixed in HEAD.Available in builds > N20060314-0010.Pinning will be possible once bug 62107 is addressed. 	2006-08-23 19:48:03	1156380000.0	resolved fixed	a91b95e	1156740000.0	java/org/apache/coyote/ajp/AjpAprProcessor.java java/org/apache/jk/core/MsgContext.java

Thanks for the pointer. I think we currently have no UI at all for the javadoc1.4 options.Note that you can always use the 'Additional options' field to enter the 1.4command line arguments.I don't know if we find time to add more UI to the wizard, maybe somebody fromthe community would be interesseed to bring the Javadoc wizard up to date? If we introduce taglets, JCore should store them. Problems in Javadoc commentscould then include the taglet rules. Will reconsider post 3.0 In addition to the taghead (to be used for Javadoc export via'-tag tagname:Xaoptcmf:""taghead""' and for rendering in the Javadoc hover), the preferences should also contain an option that tells whether the tag needs a tag description (see bug 222902).
